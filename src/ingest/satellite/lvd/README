   The lvd code is written to process the block of satellite data
that covers a laps domain. The software is dynamic and uses i/j start
end values contained in satellite_lvd.nl. lvd uses a complex namelist
file: data/static/satellite_lvd.nl which is rewritten when the
mapping (domain or satellite navigation) information changes. Although
complex, the namelist does not require significant understanding to
modify.  The file has been designed such that a user typically only
has to modify the PATH_TO_RAW_SAT, ISATS, ITYPES, and ICHANNELS
parameters. These, and other specific modifications are discussed below.

   If the raw satellite data does not cover the entire LAPS domain,
lvd uses the internal missing_data flag to identify these grid points.
The cloud analysis software uses a namelist parameter (see 
static/cloud.nl ... pct_req_lvd_s8a) to accept or reject satellite
data that partially covers a domain. All other analyses use any
satellite data available in the lvd intermediate files.

   lvd computes the navigation/remapping (lat-lon to i-j) look-up-
tables dynamically.  However, a separate executable (genlvdlut.exe)
is also built (not used) for diagnostic purposes when a user needs
to check the remapping look-up-table (LUT) generation.  The LUT's
are written to static/lvd/"satid"-llij-"channel"-"type".lut

   lvd_sat_ingest checks if the LUT's exist or whether the existing
LUT is accurate for the data type being processed. The LUT generation
code is in src/lib/satellite. The localization script removes any
existing LUT's in static/lvd which forces lvd_sat_ingest.exe to
produce new LUT's upon first execution.  The new mapping LUT's
are used thereafter until the satellite navigation or laps domain
parameters change. Note that for GVAR (gvr) type data, new LUT's are
generated automatically once per day (at ~ 0000).

   The LAPS satellite ingest creates an intermediate file with
extension "lvd" (lapsprd/lvd/"satid"/.   The
namelist works in conjunction with a data include file
src/include/sat_data_static.inc which contains static information
relevant to the executable.  LAPS library routine config_satellite_lvd
(in file read_namelist.f) loads the common block defined in src/include
/satellite_common_lvd.inc.  Recall, the information in the common block is
referenced by the namelist variables ISATS, ITYPES, and ICHANNELS.
This is why the user only needs to modify those variables
and most everything else is taken care of automatically.

The lvd output is in a specific satellite_id subdirectory (currently
there are four satellites known, one is obsolete: goes08, goes09 [obsolete],
goes10 and GMS).  lvd  processes more that one satellite simultaneously
depending on ISATS.  The satellite data format is activated with namelist
parameter ITYPES. There is a maximum of 4 satellite data format types (GVAR
[gvr], WFO [wfo], FSL-public [cdf], and AFWA [gwc]). lvd can process all
four data formats for any satellite simultaneously with the appropriate
settings of ISATS and ITYPES. For example, to process GOES08 GVAR data,
one sets ISATS=1,0,0,0,  and ITYPES=1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,.  If
one wishes to also turn on WFO GOES08 format then set ITYPES as follows:
ITYPES=1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,.  One more example is if one
wishes to process both GOES08 and GOES10 AFWA (gwc) data then it follows:
ISATS=1,0,1,0,
ITYPES=0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,.

A similar functionality exists for the channel processing which uses
namelist parameter ICHANNELS. The GOES imagers have five channels which
defines the maximum number of channels possible.  lvd can process any
one of these five, including all five. Other satellites may have fewer
channels but the channel switch conforms to the GOES channels as follows:
1. vis, 2. 3.9u, 3. 6.7u (water vapor), 4. 11.2 (window ir), 5. 12.0u.


                      RAW Satellite Data Types
                     -------------------------

lvd accepts goes08, goes09 and goes10 satellite data in several formats: 

    1. netcdf public: remapped fsl-conus [lambert] (type=cdf) and 
                      raw gvar (type=gvr).
    2. wfo SBN: also netcdf and lambert projection (type=wfo)
    3. AirForce Global Weather Center (type=gwc).
