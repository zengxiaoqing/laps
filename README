----------------- 1.0  General LAPS info --------------------------------------

     Below is a description of the tar file containing the LAPS data ingest and
     analysis code. The predictive component of LAPS (MM5, RAMS/SFM, ETA) is
     set up separately (see Section 3.4). 

     Please note that FSL provides support for LAPS software only if a prior
     agreement is made to that effect. Additionally, questions concerning LAPS
     must be asked in reference to the latest released tar file; we cannot 
     support older versions of LAPS code. It is also recommended that LAPS 
     users try to take advantage of the latest LAPS updates by periodically 
     importing a fresh tar file every few months or so. Please check the
     LAPS Software Page at 'http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/cgi/LAPS_SOFTWARE.cgi'
     for information about recent releases.

---------- 2.0 Installing and running the LAPS Ingest/Analysis code -----------

      ----------------  2.1   UNIX System Requirements  ----------------

     Supported UNIX platforms include...
<pre>
     IBM rs6000      AIX4.3            NFS mounted disks should be mounted with
                                       NFS version 2 instead of 3.
     HP              HPUX 10.20        Requires f90
     SunOS (Solaris) 5.6               Requires f90
     IRIX64          6.5               Requires f90
     DEC (Alpha)
     LINUX (Intel)                     pgf90 is suggested
     LINUX (Alpha)                     fort is suggested  
</pre>

     We are working on adding more supported platforms. We welcome suggestions
     on how to modify LAPS for other platforms/versions. Note that we cannot 
     guarantee the portability of LAPS to all of these
     other platforms (e.g. Windows NT).

                      --- 2.1.1   NetCDF library   ---
 
     The NetCDF package is required for laps, it is available via internet at 
     'http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/'
     netcdf 3.3.1 or higher is required.
     Once netCDF is properly installed, check that the 'ncdump' and 'ncgen' 
     programs are in your path (e.g. 'which ncdump'), so that 'configure' 
     will find them and provide the laps package with the proper path. 

     NetCDF is a general format structure. The detailed format of each data 
     file is self-describing (via 'ncdump'), and is mirrored in a separate 
     static file called the CDL. This CDL can be FSL's version or someone elses.

     The NetCDF library contains C routines that are to be linked with the
     LAPS FORTRAN routines. Please see the discussion in section 2.2.2.1 for
     details on troubleshooting this.
   
                      --- 2.1.2  Perl             ---

     The perl package is also required for laps, it is available via internet 
     at any perl site such as http://www.perl.com. Perl 5.003 or higher is 
     required. Check that 'perl' is in your path (e.g. 'which perl').

                      --- 2.1.3  make             ---

     Laps Makefiles work best by using gnu make (version 3.75 or higher).
     This is downloadable from gnu sites such as the following URL:
     'http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html'. You can check your version 
     of gnu make by typing 'make -v'. Some vendor provided make utilities may 
     also work, however if you find you are having problems in this area please
     try obtaining and using gnu make. Check that 'make' is in your path.

                    ---  2.1.4  C Compiler ---

     In general, an ANSI compliant C compiler should be used. On some hardware
     ANSI compliance requires a compiler flag, if you're not sure check the 
     documentation for your compiler. Some platforms such as Solaris and HPUX 
     do not come with an ANSI compliant C compiler by default.  If you have 
     not purchased that additional product from the vendor, we recommend GNU C
     (gcc) available at 'http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html'. Check that 
     the C compiler is in your path.

     For Solaris platforms, 'cc' is recommended.

     For HP-UX platforms, 'cc' is suggested.


                  ---  2.1.5  FORTRAN Compiler ---

     Please note that LAPS uses dynamic memory within the FORTRAN code in
     the form of automatic and allocatable arrays, as well as other FORTRAN 90
     constructs. This implies that you will need an 'f90' compiler or the
     equivalent. LAPS will no longer work on most 'f77' compilers. Check that 
     the FORTRAN compiler is in your path.

     For IBM/AIX platforms 'xlf' is recommended.

     For Solaris & HP-UX platforms, 'f90' works well.

     For Linux platforms (Intel chip), 'pgf90' is suggested.

     For Linux platforms (Alpha chip), 'fort' is suggested (normal serial use).

                    ---  2.1.6  Disk Space ---

     The disk space requirements for LAPS vary depending on factors such as 
     domain size and purge parameters. As a general guide, 10MB would be needed 
     for source code. About 30MB are needed for executable binaries. 
     500MB to 1GB are typically needed for 12-24 hours worth of output data. 
     A similar amount of space is needed for the raw input data.

                    ---  2.1.7  Memory Etc. (ulimit) ---

     'ulimit' settings should be placed at 'unlimited' if possible. Memory
     requirements vary for LAPS. As a general guide, 128MB is needed and
     256MB is preferred. More is needed for large domains. For very large
     domains, a rough guide to the memory needed would be 100 x NX x NY x NZ
     bytes.
   
            ---  2.1.8  Plotting / NCAR graphics library (optional)  ---

     To build the lapsplot process, access to an NCAR graphics library is 
     needed to be able to run the 'ncargf77' command. Lapsplot is an optional 
     plotting program, thus NCAR graphics is optional. You might wish to check
     the following World Wide Web location for more info on this now free
     software...

                   http://ngwww.ucar.edu

     The 'lapsplot.exe' executable is an interactive program that reads in
     the NetCDF LAPS files and produces a 'gmeta' file as output. The 'gmeta'
     file can be displayed using other NCAR graphics utilities like 'ctrans'
     and 'idt'. The 'gmeta' file can be converted into a GIF/JPEG file
     for web display by using 'ctrans' in conjunction with 'netpbm' or another
     similar method. 

     'Lapsplot' is designed to work with version 3.2 (or higher) of NCAR 
     graphics. The environment variable $NCARG_ROOT should be set when
     configuring, compiling, or running 'lapsplot.exe'. 
     
     Before running 'configure', check that 'ncargf77' is in your path, if
     you are using 'f77'. If you are using another compiler, check after
     running 'configure' to see that the right thing was done by inspecting 
     'NCARGFC' and 'FC' within 'src/include/makefile.inc'. If configure wants 
     you to use 'ncargf90', you may consider soft linking 'ncargf90' to the
     'ncargf77' script or copying 'ncargf77' to a new location and calling
     it 'ncargf90'.

     Lapsplot is built as a special option to 'make', simply type 
     'make lapsplot' or 'make install_lapsplot'. It is not built with a plain 
     run of 'make'.

     In order to get 'lapsplot' to compile and link properly it may be 
     necessary to edit your own version of 'ncargf90' or even the original 
     'ncargf77' script. A possible alternative to fixing 'ncargf77/ncargf90' 
     is to edit 'src/include/makefile.inc' with the full path for 'NCARGFC', 
     and appropriate compiler for 'FC' (and possibly compiler flags) for your 
     system (after running configure).

     At times the linking of 'lapsplot' may show undefined references to 
     library routines. This often represets a mismatch between NCAR graphics 
     and various system libraries. Possible solutions for this include editing 
     the library list within the 'ncargf77/ncargf90' script or switching the 
     -Bstatic flag on or off.

     'Lapsplot' can be modified to show political boundaries outside of the 
     U.S. The following data files are relevant from the 'static/ncarg' 
     directory: 'continent_minus_us.dat', 'state_from_counties.dat', and 
     'uscounty.dat'. These political boundary files are stored in big_endian
     format. These would need to be converted manually prior to using 
     'lapsplot', if your machine is expecting little_endian. We will consider 
     automating this in the future. 

     We are starting to put some of our web related scripts (for analyses) 
     into the repository such as 'etc/www/followup_ncarg.sh'. Web products
     are defined with some configuration files in 'static/www/lapsplot.*'.
     Color tables are specified in 'static/www/*.lut'. Other user definable
     parameters are located in 'static/lapsplot.nl'.

     To run lapsplot you can do the following...

     1. setenv LAPS_DATA_ROOT to the correct path

     2. run $LAPSINSTALLROOT/bin/lapsplot.exe (answer the questions it asks 
                                               interactively)

     3. idt gmeta

     Please note that 'lapsplot' is provided to help you check out how your
     LAPS implementation is working. The LAPB Branch does not have any other 
     plotting or visualization packages available for distribution with LAPS 
     at this time. Many users have interfaced LAPS with their own display 
     software (e.g. VIS5D, AVS, IDL, NCL, GEMPAK). Feel free to post questions
     about these to the 'laps-users' bulletin board Web Page. NCAR graphics in 
     no way is essential to the successful running of LAPS to create output 
     grids.
      
     Another note of interest is that LAPS is visualized as an integral part of
     the AWIPS system. If you have AWIPS, then LAPS should be running on it
     and you can view its output on the workstation.


     ------------- 2.2 Installation Procedure Summary ------------------

     To introduce this section, here is a hierarchical listing of some primary 
     directories and files in the laps tree. The default LAPS structure is
     shown in the first tree below. These directories are created/addressed in
     various portions of section 2.2 and beyond. 

     Various "root" directories are mentioned in the form of environment 
     variables. These can optionally be set to make it easier to follow the 
     instructions below more literally. The installation scripts can be run
     without setting these variables if you'd like to enter the associated
     paths directly as command line input.
 
     $LAPS_SRC_ROOT - The full path that was created when the LAPS tar file 
     was untarred. This contains the source code and other supporting software.
     $LAPS_SRC_ROOT is needed for building LAPS but is not needed at runtime.

     $LAPSINSTALLROOT - The full path of installed binaries and scripts 
     (bin and etc). This is where you build the executables, configure the 
     scripts (converted the *.pl.in to *.pl), and configure 
     $LAPS_SRC_ROOT/src/include/makefile.inc. Note: $LAPS_SRC_ROOT and 
     $LAPSINSTALLROOT are in many cases the same but don't have to be. 
     $LAPSINSTALLROOT is needed at runtime.

     $LAPS_DATA_ROOT - The full path to the output data and namelists. This 
     includes lapsprd subdirectories containing both LAPS output grids and 
     intermediate data files. $LAPS_DATA_ROOT is needed at runtime and it 
     contains all the files configured to run an analysis domain localized to 
     a location on earth. The $LAPSINSTALLROOT tree can drive several 
     $LAPS_DATA_ROOTs. Input data in its "raw" form is stored outside the 
     $LAPS_DATA_ROOT tree.
    
     Note: $LAPS_DATA_ROOT is usually (and recommended to be) different than 
     $LAPS_SRC_ROOT/data and $LAPSINSTALLROOT/data but they don't need to be.
     Also, $LAPS_SRC_ROOT/data/cdl and $LAPS_SRC_ROOT/data/static are 
     the repository versions and should be kept pristine.
    
     Note: the namelists you get from the tar are configured for our Colorado 
     domain.  More on localizing a domain for your own area later on.

     To summarize, these three environment variables can either be part of one
     directory tree or split out into separate trees as further discussed at 
     various times below.

     In many UNIX environments, large data files are stored on a "data" disk 
     and the source code is stored on a smaller "home" disk. Below is a
     typical laps directory structure for that setup. We recommend using
     something like this setup, especially if you are constructing and
     localizing with your own domain and parameters that are different from 
     our default Colorado setup.

            ----   2.2.1  Untarring the Source Code  ---

     Place the tar file in the directory '/home_disk' or '/home_disk/builds'.
     Untar the laps source code using a command like...
     prompt> gzcat laps-m-n-o.tar.gz | tar xf -
 
     OR...

     prompt> gunzip laps-m-n-o.tar.gz
     prompt> tar -xf laps-m-n-o.tar

     The $LAPS_SRC_ROOT directory will be set up one level below the tar file.

     If you are having trouble running 'gunzip', the problem could be that
     the 'laps-m-n-o.tar.gz' file was corrupted during the download. In that
     case simply try downloading again.

                ----   2.2.2  Running Configure ---

     Go to the $LAPS_SRC_ROOT directory and run...
     prompt> ./configure

     'configure' supports many options, the most important is the
     --prefix option which tells make where to install the laps system
     (FORTRAN executables, Perl Scripts, etc.). The default (if you did 
     not use --prefix) is to install whereever the source is. The use of 
     the --prefix option is highly recommended to make it easier to update 
     your source code (e.g. importing a new LAPS tar file), without
     disturbing the binaries, data, and runtime parameters that you are 
     working with on-site. This goes along with the second directory tree
     diagram shown above in Section 2.0.

     For example, to install laps in directory '/usr/local/laps' (i.e.
     $LAPSINSTALLROOT) use... 
     prompt> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/laps
     
     One or more data directories for running laps can be specified 
     at runtime, if desired. A single set of binaries can thus support several 
     data directories as described below. 

     Another configure option is --arch. Configure tries to get the 
     architecture from a 'uname' command, but this can be overridden by having
     an $ARCH environment variable or by using --arch. The allowed values for 
     'arch' include 'aix', 'hpux', etc.

     For more information on passing in command line flags to 'configure' run...
     prompt> ./configure --help

               ---  2.2.2.1  Modifying Compiler Flags       ---

     The 'configure' script automatically modifies the compiler and compilation 
     flags by modifying 'src/include/makefile.inc' according to what type of 
     platform you are on. Hopefully the flags will work OK on your particular
     platform. If you want to change the flags from the default set, you 
     can provide command line arguments to the 'configure' script.

     Some examples based on our experience are as follows:
    
     Solaris...
     prompt> ./configure --cc=cc

     For IBM/AIX platforms, you will want to override the default FORTRAN
     compiler with 'xlf' using the command line option --fc=xlf as follows... 
     prompt>./configure --fc=xlf 

     For SGI platforms, certain flags may be needed. '-mips3' seems to help
     on IRIX64 v6.2.

     A second method of modifying the compiler flags is to edit 
     'src/include/makefile.inc', after running configure. If you find that the
     default compiler flags don't work for your platform or that your platform
     has no default, you'll need to experiment to find the right set of flags.
     Changes in 'src/include/makefile.inc' will automatically modify the 
     flags used throughout laps. If you find flags that work for your platform
     and would like us to add them to the defaults in 'configure' please let 
     us know via e-mail. 

     On Solaris for example, you may want to remove "-C" from the DBFLAGS with
     an edit of 'src/include/makefile.inc' to allow compiling FORTRAN debug 
     versions of the software.

     On some platforms (e.g. Linux) the linking of FORTRAN programs to NetCDF
     and other C library routines may need adjustment. This relates to the 
     existence and number of underscores in the C routine names when called by
     FORTRAN routines. Fixes for this may include a combination of changing 
     the number of underscores in the C routines, changing the CPPFLAGS for 
     LAPS, or changing the FFLAGS for LAPS. 

     As an example, with errors linking to NetCDF "nf" routines, you might 
     rebuild the NetCDF C library with a different number of underscores and/or
     adjust the FFLAGS according to the man page in your FORTRAN compiler.   
     On a Linux-Intel machine the NetCDF library can be rebuilt with the 
     following flags...
     <pre>
     FC=pgf90
     CC=gcc
     CPPFLAGS=-DpgiFortran
     FFLAGS=-O
     </pre>
     Errors linking to other LAPS C routines can be addressed with other
     adjustments to the CCPFLAGS (among FORTRANUNDERSCORE and 
     FORTRANDOUBLEUNDERSCORE) or the FFLAGS.

                --- 2.2.3   Ingest Software changes ---

     In this file (mainly Sec 2.3), a number of potential manual changes to 
     ingest code are outlined prior to running 'make' and 
     '$LAPSINSTALLROOT/etc/localize_domain.pl', especially if one is using 
     ingest data formats other than "standard" ones used at FSL. After becoming
     familiar with the changes needed for your implementation, it is 
     recommended that you develop a method to save the hand edited files in a 
     "safe" place outside of the laps directory structure, or by using a 
     revision control system such as CVS.  This strategy would make it easier 
     to update your implementation of LAPS with the latest 'laps-m-n-o.tar.gz'
     file from FSL, while minimizing the hassle involved with software 
     modifications for your local implementation.


                ----   2.2.4  Running make ---

     The next step is to build and install the executables, this can be done 
     by running... 

     prompt> cd $LAPS_SRC_ROOT
     prompt> make                  1> make.out 2>&1 
     prompt> make install          1> make_install.out 2>&1 
     prompt> make install_lapsplot 1> make_install_lapsplot.out 2>&1   

     Check that the executables have been placed into the '$LAPSINSTALLROOT/bin' 
     directory. The total number should be the number of EXEDIRS in 
     '$LAPS_SRC_ROOT/Makefile' plus 2; this includes 'lapsplot.exe'.

     Lapsplot can be installed only if you have NCAR graphics.

     We recommend using Gnu Make Version 3.75 or later available via ftp from 
     any GNU site. 

     There are many other targets within the Makefile that can be used for
     specialized purposes, such as cleaning things up to get a fresh start.
     In particular, note that a 'make distclean' is recommended before running
     'configure' a second time so that things will run smoothly. 

     
            ----   2.2.5  Geography databases  ---

     Currently there are three mandatory geography databases required to
     localize a LAPS domain. These are: 

		1) terrain elevation 
		2) landuse category 
		3) albedo climatology. 

     The 30" terrain elevation data is found in the tar files for 
     'topo_30s'.

     The landuse data is global 30" data and required to compute a
     land/water mask. The mask is used during localization to force consistency
     between the other geography data at land-water boundaries. Land fraction 
     is derived from the landuse data using the water category, with valid
     values ranging continuously between 0.0 and 1.0.

     The global albedo climatology database has less resolution than either
     the terrain or landuse data.  The albedo is approximately 8.6 minutes
     (0.144 degs) and was obtained from the National Center for Environmental
     Prediction (NCEP).  This data is used in the LAPS cloud analysis with
     visible imagery data.

     The geography data come in compressed tar files separate
     from the rest of the LAPS distribution. The data are used in
     process 'gridgen_model' which is the fortran code to process all
     the geography data as specified by the user (see section 2.7.4 for more
     information about gridgen_model). Only one copy of the geography
     data is required no matter how many LAPS 'dataroot' installations you
     are supporting.  The paths to the geography data directories
     (topo_30s, landuse_30s, and albedo_ncep) are defined as
     runtime parameters within the 'nest7grid.parms' file (Sec 2.2.6). 

     In addition to the geography being available on the LAPS Home Web page
     (software link), the geography data is also available at:

                  -----------------------------------
                  ftp://ftp.fsl.noaa.gov/pub/frd-laps
                  -----------------------------------

     You will find the following global data sets at this ftp site. Some of
     the data have been subdivided into "quartershperes" for easier downloading.

     User note:

          The laps process 'gridgen_model' described below in section
          3.0 can also process soil type, mean annual soil temperature,
          and greeness fraction but these are not mandatory data required
          in LAPS and therefore we do no describe them here.  You'll see
          some reference to these data bases below and we have added
          paths to this data in our namelist file (nest7grid.parms) but
          you should enter dummy paths for these data in the event you
          do not have them available. The gridgen_model
          process will warn that these data are not available but you
          should still see the localization run to completion (ie.,
          static.nest7grid is generated).

         --- 2.2.6 Localizing for single or multiple data domains ---

     Runtime parameter changes may be needed to tailor LAPS for your
     domain(s); this includes ingest and geography data path names, 
     grid dimensions, grid location, and potentially other aspects of the 
     data processing. The parameter files are 'data/static/nest7grid.parms',
     'data/static/*.nl', and 'data/static/*/*.parms'. 

     The localization involves several operations.  The parameter files are 
     merged/updated with the repository versions if needed. The dimensions
     in the 'cdl' files are also adjusted. Then several executable programs are
     run including 'gridgen_model.exe' and 'gensfclut.exe' as per section 3.1.

     Below are two mainly equivalent procedures for localizing LAPS to set
     up one or more domains. The first is our original method for localization.
     The second is a newer, more efficient (and highly recommended) method 
     using domain "template" directories. You'll want to use either Method 1 or 
     Method 2 but not both.

                        --- 2.2.6.1 Localization Method 1 ---

     For each domain you wish to create, run... 

     prompt> cd $LAPSINSTALLROOT/etc
     prompt> perl makedatadirs.pl --srcroot=$LAPS_SRC_ROOT --installroot=$LAPSINSTALLROOT --dataroot=$LAPS_DATA_ROOT --system_type=laps

     where the path name $LAPS_DATA_ROOT must be named differently for each 
     data domain if there is more than one. Recall that each domain can be set
     up in a separate subdirectory under '/data_disk/laps'. Next, follow the 
     setup and localization steps below.

     The order of the command line arguments is important, but only the
     first one is required. If for example a $LAPS_DATA_ROOT is not supplied, 
     the dataroot tree location will default to where the LAPS binaries are 
     installed via configure. Thus, the default value of $LAPS_DATA_ROOT is 
     '$LAPSINSTALLROOT/data'.

     The runtime parameters should be emplaced and/or modified within 
     each $LAPS_DATA_ROOT directory tree prior to running the localization. 
     More details on 'nest7grid.parms' and other parameter files are 
     discussed in subsequent parts of Section 2. 

     As one option you can edit the parameter files that are in 
     '$LAPS_SRC_ROOT/data/static' and tailor them for your domain. If you have
     '$LAPS_DATA_ROOT' different from '$LAPS_SRC_ROOT/data/static', then a
     good alternative may be to copy any parameter files you need to edit into 
     '$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/static' from '$LAPS_SRC_ROOT/data/static'.

     Finally, you can create the static data files and look up tables specific 
     to the domain(s) you have defined in 'data/static/nest7grid.parms' and 
     other runtime parameter files. Shown below is an example of running the 
     localization for a particular laps domain. This should be repeated 
     (with a unique dataroot) for each domain if there is more than one. 

     prompt> cd $LAPSINSTALLROOT/etc
     prompt> perl localize_domain.pl --srcroot=$LAPS_SRC_ROOT --install_root=$LAPSINSTALLROOT --dataroot=$LAPS_DATA_ROOT --which_type = 'laps'

                    --- 2.2.6.2 Localization Method 2 ---

     The second method is especially useful if you are using a separated
     data tree and/or multiple domains. It is also recommended if you are 
     doing repeated software updates. Once you learn this method it can save
     a lot of time and errors that may occur in the course of using Method 1.

                         SETTING RUNTIME PARAMETERS

     If you are working in a separated data directory (e.g. using the
     second tree shown above), you can set up a copy of the runtime
     parameter files (for each window) in a new directory (called $TEMPLATE) 
     with a reduced parameter subset. The $TEMPLATE directory namelist files 
     should contain only those parameters that need to be changed for each of 
     the domain(s) from the settings in the repository, 
     $LAPS_SRC_ROOT/data/static. The remaining unchanged parameters should be 
     omitted from the $TEMPLATE versions. The modified $TEMPLATE parameters
     generally include map projection settings, data paths, etc. The remaining
     fixed parameters will later be automatically merged in from the 
     '$LAPS_SRC_ROOT/data/static' directory tree by the localization scripts
     (next step). This "template" procedure provides a result equivalent 
     to that from Localization Method #1 and provides an alternative method of
     modifying the parameters. Templates are normally maintained in a 
     location independent of the LAPS distribution (e.g. see the template 
     directory in the tree diagrams above). In general, they contain parameters 
     dependent on the local implementation and relatively independent of 
     software updates. Once you set up the template directory you'll be ready 
     to run the 'window_domain_rt.pl' script. Here is an example illustrating 
     the namelist merging process that is done during the localization...

                        LOCALIZING with 'window_domain_rt.pl'

     Generating new localizations, reconfiguring existing localizations, and 
     reconfiguring existing localizations without removing lapsprd or log 
     information is made easier with the perl script 'etc/window_domain_rt.pl' 
     ("window" hereafter). The window script makes use of namelist domain templates 
     that specifically define a users localizations.  The window script uses 
     environment variables $LAPS_SRC_ROOT, $LAPSINSTALLROOT, and $LAPS_DATA_ROOT, 
     however, -s, -i, and -d command-line inputs override those environment 
     variables as necessary depending on user needs.  The -t command-line input
     specifies the domain template directory and the script saves the log/lapsprd 
     history if command line switch '-c' is not used; or, completely 
     removes $LAPS_DATA_ROOT if '-c' is supplied. The '-w laps' is always
     required. The window script can be run manually when configuring or 
     reconfiguring localizations. Window copies the domain template namelists 
     (partial nest7grid.parms or *.nl's) into a new "static" subdirectory which,
     in turn, are merged with the full namelists by script localize_domain.pl.
     Recall, $LAPSINSTALLROOT contains bin/ and etc/ and $LAPS_SRC_ROOT contains
     the untarred full namelists from the repository.  

     In the event that $LAPS_SRC_ROOT does not exist, a data/ subdirectory 
     containing static/ and cdl/ must be available for use by 
     'localize_domain.pl' (i.e. $LAPS_SRC_ROOT = $LAPSINSTALLROOT). Even 
     though it is possible to have $LAPS_SRC_ROOT/data = $LAPSINSTALLROOT/data
     = $LAPS_DATA_ROOT, this is not recommended since it does not allow multiple 
     localizations. Templates will ensure that specific namelist modifications
     are merged with the untarred full namelists. Templates also ensure that 
     specifics to a localization are merged into new software ports and new 
     namelist variables (available with new software) are merged into existing 
     localizations.  


     Examples:

<pre>
setenv LAPS_SRC_ROOT /usr/nfs/common/lapb/operational/laps
setenv LAPSINSTALLROOT /usr/nfs/lapb/operational/laps
setenv LAPS_DATA_ROOT "any existing LAPS_DATA_ROOT" 

a) window_domain_rt.pl -w laps:   

   result: lapsprd and log saved; operational namelists and cdl's are copied
           into $LAPS_DATA_ROOT/static; $LAPSINSTALLROOT/bin/gridgen_model.exe
           runs to regenerate static.nest7grid. "Saved" lapsprd and log are
           restored into $LAPS_DATA_ROOT.
  
b) window_domain_rt.pl -c -w laps:
  
   result: same as a) although lapsprd and log are removed and regenerated by
           "etc/makedatadirs.pm"
  
c) window_domain_rt.pl -t "full path to template directory" -w laps
  
   result: similar to a) but namelist specifics are copied to $LAPS_DATA_ROOT/
           static and merged with full namelists in $LAPSINSTALLROOT.

d) window_domain_rt.pl -s $LAPS_SRC_ROOT -i $LAPSINSTALLROOT -d $LAPS_DATA_ROOT
                     -t "full path to template directory" -w laps

   result: similar to c) except all required information is provided on the
           command line. Window will use the command line info instead of 
           getting the paths from the environment.

setenv LAPS_SRC_ROOT /awips/laps
setenv LAPSINSTALLROOT /data/fxa/laps_data
setenv LAPS_DATA_ROOT /data/fxa/laps

e) window_domain_rt.pl -t /data/fxa/laps_template -s /awips/laps \
                       -i /awips/laps -c -w laps
  
   result: Specific AWIPS relocalization command for lapstools GUI. GUI writes
           user input to laps_template/ (subset namelists; eg., 
           nest7grid.parms); $LAPS_DATA_ROOT/static and cdl/ are moved to 
           laps_data/; $LAPS_DATA_ROOT is removed; new $LAPS_DATA_ROOT is 
           generated and subdirectory structure created by 
           "etc/makedatadirs.pm"; laps_template namelist are copied to new 
           $LAPS_DATA_ROOT; localize_domain.pl merges $LAPSINSTALLROOT/ and

                  ---  2.3    Raw data ingest   ---

     There is a layer of "raw" data ingest code that may have to be modified
     for the individual location depending on data formats. Its purpose is
     to reformat and preprocess the various types of raw data into simple common 
     formats used by the subsequent analyses. It also helps to modularize the 
     software. 

     Working with the ingest code is usually the largest task within the porting 
     of LAPS. The supported component of the LAPS code is the analysis section. 
     Ingest code is supported only if your raw data looks has the same 
     configuration and format as FSL's raw data. It is the reponsibility of the
     LAPS user to modify the LAPS ingest code if necessary to generate the 
     intermediate data files that are inputs to the analysis code. 

     A flow chart for the ingest processes may be found at
     'http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/wharton/slide1.html'.

     The default LAPS ingest code obtains "raw" data, generally from the FSL 
     NIMBUS system. The raw data can either be in ASCII, NetCDF (as point 
     data), or NetCDF (as gridded data - generally not on the LAPS grid). Note
     that the ingest code is also generally compatable with raw SBN/NOAAPORT 
     data as stored in NetCDF files on the WFO-Advanced system. The ingest 
     code processes the raw data and outputs the LAPS "intermediate" data 
     files. The intermediate files are generally in ASCII for point data and 
     NetCDF format for gridded data that have now been remapped onto the LAPS 
     grid. Most ingest code is located under the 'src/ingest directory'. When 
     NetCDf format is used for the raw data, a cdl file for the raw data is 
     sometimes included in the source code directory.
  
     Depending on the data source, you may generally prefer one of three 
     choices:

         1) Modify LAPS ingest code to accept your own raw data format.
            This often entails writing a subroutine that reads the data and
            linking this routine into the existing ingest process. That
            process then writes out the LAPS intermediate file. Note that 
            generating an FSL style raw data file is not here needed - all
            that really counts is producing an intermediate data file. 
 
         2) Run a process independent of the LAPS ingest code that creates
            the intermedate data file. 

         3) Convert your raw data to NetCDF format then run the LAPS ingest
            code as is. The CDLs and sample "raw" NetCDF files supplied with
            our test dataset can serve as a guide to writing the software
            to do this. If the CDL is unavailable, doing 'ncdump -h' on
            the actual data file will yield equivalent information. We 
            generally do not maintain or support any software for writing 
            "raw" NetCDF files as this is done external to LAPS. Sometimes by 
            posting a message to 'laps-users' you can obtain information from 
            other LAPS users as to how they may have implemented this step.

     For gridded data sources such as the model background, generally (1) or
     (3) is easiest. For surface and other point data sources option (2) is 
     sometimes the easiest route.

     You may note the following data sources used at FSL. These data sources
     are what the FSL ingest code is tailored to for producing intermediate
     data files. Note that LAPS will still run even if some of the data sources
     are withheld, albeit in degraded fashion. A minimum dataset of model 
     background and surface observations is generally needed to get reasonable 
     results.

     The pathnames for the ingest data sources are assigned within the 
     './data/static/nest7grid.parms' and other '*.nl' files and can be set 
     accordingly at runtime. Doing a grep for 'path' in these files will
     give you a quick listing of the relevant parameters.

     Unless otherwise specified, the time window for data in the
     intermediate data files should be '+/- laps_cycle_time_cmn'. 
     The time window for data in the raw data files is more variable and is 
     generally specified within the raw data (e.g. in the CDL).

     Further information on specific LAPS ingest processes for the various 
     data sources is found in Section 3 of this README.

                 ----   2.3.1  Model Background (lga/lgb) ---

     The model first guess (background) is generally on a larger-scale
     grid than LAPS and is run independently. The model data is 
     interpolated to the LAPS grid by the LAPS ingest to produce 
     'lga/lgb' files. This 'lga/lgb' output is distinct from the 
     'fua/fsf' files that are first guess files of similar format 
     generated by the LAPS forecast model using an intermittent 4dda  
     mode.

     The 'nest7grid.parms' namelist variable "fdda_model_source" controls
     the background used in the analysis, including lga.  A list of
     "fdda" backgrounds that are available with this release are
     specified in file etc/laps_tools.pm - module mkdatadirs.  Even
     though fdda subdirectories are populated with current backgrounds,
     the analysis can be forced to override this by making the first
     entry of "fdda_model_source" = 'lga'.

     The acceptable models and formats for the background model are listed in
     'data/static/background.nl'. As of the current release only bgmodels
     2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 have been tested and evaluated for Eta, RUC and
     AVN and the Taiwan "nf" and "re" models.  There is not guarentee
     that any other models specified in background.nl will work.  LAPS
     developers will expand the list backgrounds in upcoming releases.

     RUC grids are ftp'ed from NCEP to FSL, then converted at FSL from 
     GRIB to NetCDF. This NetCDF file is the input for the LAPS ingest
     process that writes "lga". 

     You might wish to check the following URLs on the WWW for...

     more RUC info:  'http://maps.fsl.noaa.gov/MAPS.rucinfo.cgi'
     more GRIB info: 'http://sslab.colorado.edu:2222/datastandards.html'

     RUC is also available from UNIDATA and distributed to universities 
     through private companies like Alden. 

     The conversion from GRIB to NetCDF is done outside of LAPS by FSL's 
     Information and Technology Services (ITS) division (in the NIMBUS system).
     Having the CDL should mostly be sufficient along with general knowledge 
     of NetCDF for writing out the data. Beyond that, you may wish to contact 
     the ITS division for more info (given that some type of funding 
     arrangement with them exists). The Atlanta, Sterling, and Seattle WFOs 
     have followed a more direct route, going from the RUC/Eta to the 
     intermediate "lga" file, bypassing the NetCDF file on the model grid. 
     This includes RUC on isobaric surfaces. 

                       ----   2.3.2  Radar ingest ---

     The following are intermediate files for various forms of radar
     data. These may have already been pre-processed (remapped) from "raw" 
     data, and at this stage are in Cartesian format on the LAPS grid.

<pre>

           (vrc)                 - Low-level reflectivity from single or 
                                   multiple radars. For example, our ingest 
                                   at FSL processes WSI-NOWRAD, stored at FSL 
                                   in NetCDF, to create the 'vrc' intermediate 
                                   file. Narrowband single-tilt data from AWIPS
                                   is also stored in 'vrc' files.

           (v01, v02, ... )      - WSR-88Ds or other radar data are stored as
                                   a full volume. 

                                 - Each 'vxx' file has 3-d reflectivity,
                                   velocity, and nyquist velocity for one 
                                   radar. Horizontal and vertical gaps are
                                   filled in for reflectivity while sparse 
                                   arrays are used for velocity.

           (vrz)                 - 3-D reflectivity mosaic from multiple radars
                                   ('vxx' files). 

           (ln3)                 - Layer reflectivity and echo tops, from a
                                   single radar or mosaiced from multiple 
                                   radars. For example, WSI sends put a variety
                                   of derived products from the WSR-88D's 
                                   which we call nexrad products. These 
                                   include 3 layer reflectivity products, 
                                   a composite reflectivity, echo tops, and 
                                   vil.  FD also decodes these and writes 
                                   netCDF files. We have an experimental 
                                   process called 'ln3' that ingests these 
                                   data that we haven't yet approved for 
                                   release in our tar. This will probably 
                                   happen shortly though as the need 
                                   to further test/use this 3D reflectivity in
                                   LAPS is increasing.
				   As of 9-22-98 we have committed the ln3 ingest
				   process to our repository and distribute this
				   source code with our tarfile.  The reliability
				   of echo tops in conjunction with the layer
                                   reflecitivity information still makes this a
                                   problematical data set to use in the analyses.
				   Committing this source to the repository will
				   help to further investigate the utility of this
                                   product.
                                   The key fields from 'ln3' which are used
                                   in the analyses are the Layer reflectivity
                                   (0-4 km MSL, 4-8 km MSL, and >8 km MSL), as
                                   well as echo tops (MSL).

     A flow chart showing radar data usage in LAPS is on the Web at:
     'http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/albers/laps/radar/laps_radar_ingest.html',
     together with some text details in:
     'http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/albers/radar_decision_tree.txt'.
     These include information on which types of radar data are processed 
     via the various intermediate data files.

     Further information on using individual radar ingest processes is in 
     Section 3. Specifically we should establish whether your raw data is in 
     polar or Cartesian form. If polar, please take a look at "Polar Radar 
     Data" in section 3.2.3. NOWRAD / WSI (Cartesian) data is covered separately 
     within Section 3.2.4.
      
                       ----   2.3.3  Surface Data ---

     Sfc Obs (lso): FSL uses this data primarily in FSL's NIMBUS NetCDF format
           as input. A few other formats are now being supported, as listed
           in the 'static/obs_driver.nl' namelist. The FSL code is in the 
           '.../src/ingest/sao' directory, and includes routines to read and 
           reformat different surface data (METAR/SYNOP, mesonet or local/LDAD,
           buoy/ship or maritime, and GPS/profiler surface obs). Users may need
           to modify/write the necessary routines to read their data formats 
           to be able to output the ASCII LSO file. Paths to the datasets 
           are specified in the 'obs_driver.nl' file. Looking at the routines 
           in the '.../src/ingest/sao' directory should provide enough 
           information to get you started on any needed modifications.

           The surface data, including all the types mentioned above, over much
           of the U.S. is available in realtime from FSL with some restrictions. 
           This data, in 'WFO/AWIPS' NetCDF format, is distributed via FSL's
           MADIS project at http://www-sdd.fsl.noaa.gov/MADIS/
      
                      ----   2.3.4  Profiler / RASS ---

     Profilers/RASS (pro/lrs) - The raw data are obtained from FSL's NIMBUS 
           database and/or AWIPS in NetCDF format where they are stored in 
           four different directories. The data originally come from FSL's 
           Demonstration Division (DD) from two main networks. The 30+ NPN 
           (National Profiler Network - NOAAnet) profiler network is located 
           mostly in the central U.S. 

           We are also using a network of experimental boundary layer profilers
           (BLP - external directory) for both wind and temperature. These
           are available over the internet directly from FSL/DD at the 
           following location...
           ftp://oak.fsl.noaa.gov/outgoing/blp/ 

           The profiler data for wind goes into the 'pro' intermediate file, 
           and RASS temperature profiles go into the 'lrs' intermediate file. 
           Note that the cdl's associated with each data source indicate the
           time frequency of the data that our ingest code can process.

           To summarize...
<pre>

           * Indicates that this data with this cdl is available, but our
             ingest code would need modification to process it.
</pre>                 

           The profiler data is also available via another route from FSL with
           some restrictions. This data, in 'WFO/AWIPS' NetCDF format, is 
           distributed via FSL's MADIS project at 
           http://www-sdd.fsl.noaa.gov/MADIS/


                      ----   2.3.5  PIREPS & ACARS from aircraft ---

     PIREPS (pin) - We are ingesting FSL NIMBUS and WFO/AWIPS (NetCDF) pirep 
           files to translate the cloud layers from voice pilot reports into 
           intermediate "PIN" files.

     ACARS (pin) - We are ingesting FSL NIMBUS, WFO/AWIPS (NetCDF) and AFWA 
           databases for ACARS data to translate the automated aircraft 
           observations. The wind, temperature and humidity obs are appended 
           to our intermediate "PIN" file. A NIMBUS equivalent NetCDF database 
           is available (with some restrictions) on the Web at 
           http://acweb.fsl.noaa.gov.

                      ----   2.3.6  RAOB / Dropsonde / Radiometer ---

     RAOBs (snd):
           FSL NIMBUS, WFO/AWIPS, CWB, or AFWA databases. These are available 
           in real-time from FSL with some restrictions. RAOB data in 
           'WFO/AWIPS' NetCDF format is distributed via FSL's MADIS project at 
           http://www-sdd.fsl.noaa.gov/MADIS/

     Dropsondes (snd):
           A Dropsonde ingest module has been developed for the CWB database. 
           Under current development is an ingest module for AVAPS. We may 
           include modules for other databases in the future, such as NIMBUS
           or WFO/AWIPS.          

     Radiometers (snd):
           A radiometer ingest module has been developed for the MADIS
           database - http://www-sdd.fsl.noaa.gov/MADIS/ 

                      ----   2.3.7  Satellite ---

     Satellite Image Ingest (lvd): GOES data ingest. Data is stored at
           FSL in NetCDF or AWIPS/NOAAPORT/SBN data (also in NetCDF). Ingest of
           Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) satellite data is also possible.  
           Raw GVAR satellite data can be ingested and navigated using GIMLOC 
           routines. Further details can be found in the file 
           'src/ingest/satellite/lvd/README'. Another option under development 
           is to use flat files (ascii files generated by RAMSDIS or binary 
           data) as input. The flat file ingest is still under development as 
           of 3-11-98.

     Satellite Sounder Ingest (lsr): GOES satellite sounder data ingest. 
           Program lsr_driver.exe processes data from both satellites.
           Product files are yyjjjhhmm.lsr and stored in subdirectories 
           lapsprd/lsr/'satid'. Nineteen channels. Output is Radiance. The 
           namelist data/static/sat_sounder.nl defines the appropriate 
           parameters for this ingest process. Only the moisture analysis is 
           using this product. Currently FSL /public sounder files in netCDF 
           format are processed.

     Satellite soundings (snd): The 'snd' file can support satellite soundings
           though you probably will have to supply your own routine to convert
           your raw data into the 'snd' format (mixed in with other types of
           soundings). 

                      ----   2.3.8  GPS ---

     GPS:
           LAPS uses GPS data from NIMBUS NetCDF files. The precipitable water
           is used in the humidity analysis and surface observations are
           read into the surface analyses.

           There is a second format known as (LDAD) NetCDF that carries GPS 
           data. This format can supply GPS surface data to the LAPS 
           intermediate 'lso' file. LAPS does not yet read precipitable water 
           from the LDAD format.

                      ----   2.3.9  Other Data Sources ---

     Radar VAD Algorithm winds (pro)
           FSL NIMBUS database, from WSR-88D algorithm output. FSL obtains
           this from NCEP and does not presently redistribute it.

     SODAR data (pro) - This is treated in a similar manner to wind profilers 
           and can be processed by LAPS ingest to appear in the PRO file.
           This is available as part of the RSA project at Kennedy and
           Vandenberg Space Centers and comes into NetCDF format via 
           AWIPS/LDAD.

     Met Tower data (snd) - This is treated in a similar manner to RAOBs
           and can be processed by LAPS ingest to appear in the SND file.
           This is available as part of the RSA project at Kennedy and
           Vandenberg Space Centers and comes into NetCDF format via 
           AWIPS/LDAD.

     Satellite derived soundings (snd):
           AFWA database format. Previously used at FSL but not currently.

     Cloud Drift Winds (cdw):
           We are ingesting the ASCII satellite cloud-drift wind files
           for use in the wind analysis. These come from NESDIS (via NIMBUS)
           as well as from CWB and AFWA.

               ---  2.4  Running LAPS Analyses  ---

     LAPS runs in real-time under cron; there is a sample cron script in 
     '$LAPSINSTALLROOT/util/cronfile'. Referring to this cron, you can 
     see that once each hour (or other cycle time), the main './etc/sched.pl' 
     runs. As an example at FSL, we run the 'sched.pl' hourly at :20 after the
     top of the hour. By inspecting the 'sched.pl' file you can see the various
     executables that are run in a certain order. You might want to modify the 
     'sched.pl' file for your needs. 

     In the sample cron script several ingest processes are run separately
     from the 'sched.pl'. For example the satellite ingest (lvd) is run 
     several times per hour and utilizes './etc/laps_driver.pl'. NOWRAD 
     Radar ingest (vrc) is also run at more frequent intervals. You might also
     choose to run 'remap_polar_netcdf.exe' for radar ingest in this manner.

     On many unix systems jobs that run in cron do not have access to the 
     environment defined by the user. They instead use a system default 
     environment defined in '/etc/profile'; thus 'perl' may not be in the $PATH..
     The cron file uses the full path to 'perl' to ensure that this will 
     not be a problem. If the path to 'ncgen' is not in '/etc/profile', then
     you may want to add this to your own '.profile' file.

     Each script in the cron requires the path to laps as a command line 
     argument. A second optional argument specifies the path to the laps data 
     directory structure; this path defaults to '/fullpathto/laps/data' if not
     provided.

     The 'util/cronfile' is created by the configure step. Much of the needed
     editing has already been done in the creation of this file. You might see
     some remaining '@....@' constructs though that can be edited either 
     manually or by running the 'cronfile.pl' (next paragraph). The 
     @laps_data_root@ can be replaced with your path to $LAPS_DATA_ROOT and the
     optional @followup@ can be replaced with anything you wish to run after 
     the 'sched.pl' has completed (using a semicolon to separate the two 
     commands).

     There is also a script called 'etc/cronfile.pl' that creates a modified
     version of 'util/cronfile' tailored to a given domain. This script can be 
     run manually and the output location of the cronfile is located in 
     '$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/cronfile'.

               ----   2.4.1  Cron timing considerations ---

     The best timing of the cron is often related to the arrival time
     of the raw surface observations. For example, if most of the surface
     data arrives within 20 minutes of the observation time, then running
     the cron 20 minutes after the 'systime' would be optimum. The time window
     for acceptance of surface stations in the LSO file can be controlled
     by runtime parameters in 'obs_driver.nl'.

     Once we get the 'sfc_qc.exe' Kalman module operating in LAPS, we may be 
     able to recommend running LAPS earlier. In that future mode, LAPS would
     process each most recent observation available and project ahead if
     needed any observations that did not yet arrive for the current 
     'systime'.

     In most cases, the data cutoff time window for 3D observations is
     +/-laps_cycle_time/2 or +/-laps_cycle_time. For example an hourly
     LAPS cycle accepts RAOB data from a +/-60 minute time window and
     ACARS from a +/-30 minute window.

               ----   2.4.2  Purging Output Files ---

     The script '/etc/purger.pl' purges the 'lapsprd' output files and
     is in turn run by the 'sched.pl'. There are default settings in place for
     the number of files and age of files to be kept. These can be overridden
     in three ways. 

     1) The 'sched.pl' command line options '-r -m N', where "N" is the 
        (default) maximum number of files to be kept in each product directory
        by the purger

     2) Overrides can be read in from '/data/static/purger.dat'. You can see 
        the 'purger.pl' script to see how that information is used.
 
     3) Simply edit the 'purger.pl' to change it accordingly.

               ---  2.5  Test data case  ---

     Tar files containing test data (called 'lapsdata*') are available that 
     contain a snapshot of several hour's worth of laps data from the Colorado 
     domain using namelist settings taken from the repository. The tar files 
     include intermediate files from the 'ingest' code plus outputs from 
     the 'analysis' code. Several consecutive analysis cycles are posted with
     one file per cycle. Included are the contents of the 'lapsprd', 'time', 
     'static', and 'log' subdirectories under 'data' or $LAPS_DATA_ROOT. The 
     log files are useful for diagnosing any differences in output you may 
     observe. The contents of the various directories are outlined elsewhere 
     in this README file. The data was created using the latest software 
     release. Our users can download this data at this URL:

           'http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/cgi/LAPS_SOFTWARE.cgi'.

     It is suggested here to test the localization procedure to ensure that all
     the static files needed to run LAPS are present. To do this, check that 
     the paths to the geography data are correct in '$TEMPLATE/nest7grid.parms'
     and/or '$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/static/nest7grid.parms'.

     When running LAPS as a whole for the archived data, the 'etc/sched.pl' 
     script will accept a '-A' command line argument. This forces the script
     to run for the time you are inputting instead of the current time. 
     An example call is shown as follows...

     prompt> perl sched.pl  -A dd-mmm-yyyy-hhmm $LAPSINSTALLROOT $LAPS_DATA_ROOT

     ...where the inputted 'dd-mmm-yyyy-hhmm' value is the date (for example
     28-Aug-2002-1200). This date can be inferred from the contents of
     '$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/time/systime.dat'. Best results are obtained when using 
     a time at or near the latest raw data tarfile times.

     One can also initiate individual executables (bin directory) listed in the
     'sched.pl' to run on the test data. This often helps in getting a better
     match between your output and ours. Note that $LAPS_DATA_ROOT needs to
     be set as an environment variable when executables are run individually.
     The time of the run is specified in '$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/time/systime.dat'. 
     This can be modified if needed if you want to try a slightly different 
     time from the one supplied. To do this, interactively run the script
     '$LAPSINSTALLROOT/etc/systime.pl' and write the standard output to
     '$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/time/systime.dat'.

     Note that for any given process or set of processes, deviations from the 
     FSL output may be caused by differences in the inputs as well as machine 
     roundoff error. Most, but perhaps not all of the input data is supplied. 
     One main area to check would be differences in available "raw" background
     data files. Having all of the data history from 'lapsprd' may also be an
     issue; this may be less of a problem if you run laps for the latest hour
     of data that is supplied. The history is then supplied from earlier 
     'lapsdata*/lapsprd' output. Output differences can be tracked down by 
     recompiling specific analyses with the '-g' option. This can be done by 
     typing 'make debug' in the appropriate 'src' directories. Various 
     debuggers can then be used such as 'dbx'. Examination of the log files 
     again is helpful.

     We have a new script (in 2004) called 'casererun.pl' that can be used
     for archive data runs. We have yet to try it on the supplied test data 
     case though it could prove to be useful.

                ----  2.5.1  Analysis Only Test ---

     You may want to check that any analysis outputs from this time are not 
     present, leaving only the 'ingest' outputs in place. This may improve
     the results of comparisons of your own output with FSL analysis output, 
     though this step is not always necessary. You might consider commenting 
     the ingest processes from the 'sched.pl' for this test, since the ingest 
     outputs (i.e. analysis inputs) will already be present.

     One way to supply the analysis inputs is as follows for each input (taken
     from a list of ingest outputs, see section 3.2):

     prompt> cp testdata/lapsprd/input1/*           data/lapsprd/lapsprd/input1

                                   OR

     prompt> cd data/lapsprd
     prompt> ln -s testdata/lapsprd/input1/*        input1

     You might check to ensure that the purger will not accidentally purge
     any archived analysis files you want to keep in your $LAPS_DATA_ROOT. 
     Either a copy of these files should be kept elsewhere or the purger can 
     be disabled using the command line arguments 'sched.pl -r -m N', where 
     N is a large number of files to keep in each directory. 

                ----  2.5.2  Ingest + Analysis Test ---

     For this type of test, you will want to download the 'rawdata*' tar files
     into your 'raw_data' directory to start the processing of LAPS. Recall
     that the 'raw_data' directory is on a separate tree than $LAPS_DATA_ROOT.
     The time information will be needed in the form of 'data/time/systime.dat';
     this can be extracted from the 'lapsdata*' tar file.

     The 'raw_data' directory is a convenient place to store test data. User
     supplied raw data for operational runs can be stored anywhere on your
     system, often outside of the LAPS trees.

     Note that the 'lapsdata*' tar files contain intermediate plus analysis
     output files only. The 'rawdata*' tar files supply much of the "raw" data
     that are inputted to the ingest processes. The times for the raw data 
     match the 'lapsdata*' output approximately but not always exactly
     (one example being the raw background data files). In many cases, a user
     could independently generate the intermediate data files (ingest output)
     and could then compare them with ours. If other "raw" files are needed 
     as they appear on FSL's NIMBUS system, please let us know and we can
     try to add them to our test data case or send them separately.

---------------- 2.6 ------ I/O of LAPS gridded files -------------------------

     Once the laps library is compiled (as outlined above), laps grids can
     be read. There are three levels of software that can access the data.
<pre>
     1. Lowest Level - NetCDF c routine calls (not recommended unless you're
                                               a NetCDF hacker)

     2. Medium Level - READ_LAPS_DATA - look at the source code in 
        lib/readlapsdata.f for the arguments.

     3. Highest (and easiest) level - get_laps_3d or get_laps_2d. The source
        is contained in src/lib/laps_io.f. The various grids available are
        listed later in this README file under the heading "NetCDF organization"
</pre>
     To link to the reading routines, you will want to link to:

     laps/src/lib/liblaps.a
     libnetcdf.a


-------------- 2.7 ----  CHANGING THE HORIZONTAL DOMAIN-----------------------

     Laps will allow you to change the horizontal domain after compilation
     and before the running of the localization scripts. Below is a list of 
     the relevant changes.

     The dimensions and location of the horizontal domain can be changed at 
     run time. Prior to running 'window_domain_rt.pl', set the following 
     parameters in 'data/static/nest7grid.parms' or in the corresponding 
     template directory (needed only if you are outside the default Colorado 
     domain). This script in turn runs 'gridgen_model.exe' and other programs.

                ----  2.7.1 Number of Grid Points ---

     Adjust the horizontal dimensions in terms of the number of grid points
           (NX_L_CMN, NY_L_CMN) in './data/static/nest7grid.parms'.


     NOTE: Various files in the ./data/cdl directory are automatically edited
           by ./etc/localize_domain.pl using the values found in 
           './data/static/nest7grid.parms'.


          ----  2.7.2 Location of Domain (Map projections) ---

<pre>
                      
        1) Modify the 'grid_spacing_m_cmn' parameter (only if you want to 
                change from the default 10000m for the grid spacing).

                Grid spacing in meters on the projection plane. Used for all 
                projections.
                 
        2) Modify the 'grid_cen_lat_cmn' and 'grid_cen_lon_cmn' parameters.

                These are the latitude and longitude of the center of the
                domain, expressed in degrees. The parameters are needed for
                all projections.

             
        3) c6_maproj:
                
                Polar stereographic: 
                    Set to 'plrstr'. 

                Lambert Conformal:
                    Set to 'lambrt'.

                Mercator:
                    Set to 'merctr'.

                In most cases, the Lambert projection is recommended.

                Mercator is recommended if the domain includes the
                equator, or for domains centered in the tropics where 
                sin(latitude) varies by more than a factor of two over the 
                domain.

                If the domain includes one of the geographic poles, then
                Polar Stereographic should be used instead.

                See the note below regarding current map projection limitations.
                
        4) standard_longitude:
                        
                Polar Stereographic:
                    This defines the longitude which is straight up and down 
                    (parallel to the "y" axis) in the map projection.
               
                Lambert Conformal:
                    This defines the longitude which is straight up and down 
                    (parallel to the "y" axis) in the map projection.
                  
                Mercator:
                    N/A
                                       
        5) standard_latitude:
                                         
                Polar Stereographic:
                    This is the latitude at which the grid spacing is exactly 
                    the nominal value ('grid_spacing_m_cmn' e.g. 10km). 

                    This parameter is usually set to +/-90 degrees to match
                    the latitude of the projection pole ('standard_latitude2'),
                    given that the projection pole is at one of earth's 
                    geographic poles. The actual grid spacing (measured on   
                    the earth's surface) matches the 'grid_spacing_m_cmn' 
                    parameter at the projection pole, which may or may not be 
                    located within your domain. For domains distant from the 
                    projection pole, the actual grid spacing inside the domain
                    becomes noticeably less. The value of 'grid_spacing_m_cmn'
                    can be increased to compensate. The projection plane is
                    tangent to the earth's surface.
                    
                    When the projection pole is at a geographic pole, 
                    'standard_latitude' can be set to values other than +/-90.
                    The 'grid_spacing_m_cmn' parameter then represents the 
                    true grid spacing (measured on the earth's surface) at a 
                    latitude of 'standard_latitude'. The projection plane
                    is secant to the earth's surface. 
                     
                    Consider the angle 'psi' which is the angular distance from
                    the pole of the projection. 'phi' = 90 - 'psi'. The map
                    factor 'sigma' is (1+sin(phi0))/(1+sin(phi)) and becomes
                    unity when 'phi' for a particular grid point is equal to 
                    'phi0'. This occurs when you are located at the 
                    'standard_latitude' for the case of a "secant" projection.
                    Note that the grid spacing for a particular location in
                    the domain is equal to 'grid_spacing_m_cmn'/'sigma'.

                     
                    Example 1: grid_spacing_m_cmn = 10000.
                               standard_latitude  =   +90.
                               standard_latitude2 =   +90.
                               grid_cen_lat_cmn   =   +40.
                   
                               grid_spacing at projection (north) pole = 10km
                               grid_spacing at domain center (+40)     ~  8km
                                                    
                     
                    Example 2: grid_spacing_m_cmn = 10000.
                               standard_latitude  =   +40.
                               standard_latitude2 =   +90.
                               grid_cen_lat_cmn   =   +40.
                     
                               grid_spacing at projection (north) pole ~ 12km
                               grid_spacing at domain center (+40)     = 10km
                                                     
                    Example 3: grid_spacing_m_cmn = 10000.
                               standard_latitude  =   -90.
                               standard_latitude2 =   -90.
                               grid_cen_lat_cmn   =   +40.
                          
                               grid_spacing at projection (south) pole = 10km
                               grid_spacing at domain center (-40)     ~  8km
                     
                    Example 4: grid_spacing_m_cmn = 10000.
                               standard_latitude  =   -40.
                               standard_latitude2 =   -90.
                               grid_cen_lat_cmn   =   -40.
                        
                               grid_spacing at projection (south) pole ~ 12km
                               grid_spacing at domain center (-40)     = 10km
                                                                

                    Note that the 'Dx' and 'Dy' values that appear in the 
                    'static.nest7grid' should equal the value of
                    'grid_spacing_m_cmn'.
                         
                Lambert:
                    This is the latitude at which the grid spacing is exactly 
                    the nominal value (e.g. 10km). 
                   
                Mercator:
                    This is the latitude at which the grid spacing is exactly 
                    the nominal value (e.g. 10km). 
                                     
        6) standard_latitude2:
             
                Polar Stereographic:
                    This must be set to +90. or -90. and defines the pole 
                    latitude of the polar stereographic projection 
                    (Earth's North or South Pole). 

                Lambert:
                    For a tangent lambert (e.g. CONUS), set this equal to
                    the 'standard_latitude' parameter. For a secant 
                    (two-latitude) lambert, set this to the second true 
                    latitude.

                Mercator:
                    N/A

        When you run ./etc/localize_domain.pl, the NetCDF static 
        file 'static.nest7grid' will be automatically generated by process
        'gridgen_model.exe'. This contains grids of latitude, longitude, 
        elevation, and land (vs. water) fraction.

        The following output message, "topo_30s file /U50N119W does not exist",
        does not necessarily mean there is a problem. It may signify that 
        your domain runs outside the available 30" data, and should still be 
        covered by the 10' worldwide data, if you are using the 'topo_30s'
        dataset. Other WARNINGs or ERRORs may be more significant.

          ----  2.7.2.1 MAP PROJECTION FUNCTIONALITY/LIMITATIONS  ---

     LAPS runs with the polar stereographic, lambert, and mercator projections.
   Please let us know if you encounter any problems.

     The polar stereographic projection has a pole that may be set to either
   earth's north or south geographic poles. 

     Setting the pole to an arbitrary lat/lon (local stereographic) is a
   possible future enhancement. A test local stereographic domain gave an 
   error of 2km in the grid points; the test code works in cases where the 
   projection pole coincides with the center of the domain. Further 
   improvement of this may include more fully converting library subroutines 
   'GETOPS' and (possibly) 'PSTOGE' to double precision. 

     The projection rotation routine 'projrot_laps' also has some 
   approximations when local stereographic is used. These need to be checked
   for their validity and refined if needed. Cases of interest include a 
   projection pole point at the domain center, as well as offset from the
   center.

     The map projection calculations are performed with a spherical earth
   assumption.

                   ----  2.7.3 Domain Resolution  ---

     The default value of the 'grid_spacing_m_cmn' parameter is 10000m. This is
   one of the parameters used in constructing the static file (as mentioned 
   above). To date, we have run LAPS with resolutions ranging from 1000m to 
   48000m.

                 ----  2.7.4 Terrain Smoothing/Filtering  ---

    Edit the file 'data/static/nest7grid.parms'...
<pre>
        1) silavwt_parm_cmn: 

           Default value of 0. This parameter allows the potential use of 
           silhouette terrain which is the maximum elevation in the local area.
           Useful range is anywhere between 0-1. A value of zero uses the 
           average terrain instead of the maximum. Note that a value of 1 
           may reduce the apparent effect of filtering with 'toptwvl_parm'.
           
        2) toptwvl_parm_cmn: 

           For example, a value of 4 represents 4 delta-x filtering of the 
           terrain. You can change this to alter the smoothness of the 
           terrain. Higher numbers mean smoother terrain.

--------- 2.8  ----- CHANGING THE VERTICAL DOMAIN------------------------------


   NUMBER OF LEVELS:

     To do this, perform the following between untarring the tar file and
    compiling 

     1. Edit 'data/static/nest7grid.parms'
       
        Change the parameter 'nk_laps' to be equal to the (number of vertical 
        levels).

     2. Note that not all data sources have been tested with other than
        21 vertical levels, particularly some aspects of the forward radiance
        model used in satellite data processing, and compatibility with 
        model background data will depend of the vertical extent of that 
        data source.

   PRESSURE OF THE LEVELS (and vertical resolution):

     To do this, perform the following between untarring the tar file and
     compiling

     1. Edit 'data/static/pressures.nl'

        Update the list of pressures so that it is consistent with the
        other vertical grid parameters mentioned above.

     Note that the vertical grid uses pressure coordinates and that the 
     vertical pressure interval can vary between levels. Of course, the 
     top pressure should be greater than zero mb. The bottom level should 
     extend below the terrain and below the observations.

   Note: If you are feeding LAPS output into an AWIPS workstation, then
   additional workstation related changes may be needed.

-------- 2.9 ----- CHANGING THE CYCLE TIME -----------------------------------

        The default cycle time is 60 minutes. To change this, do as follows...
 
     1. Edit runtime parameter file 'data/static/nest7grid.parms' 
        to change the value of 'laps_cycle_time'.

 ----- 2.10 ----------LQ3 (HUMIDITY ANALYSIS) CHANGES---------------------

NAMELIST

The namelist file ./laps/static/moisture_switch.nl controls the data
assimilation within the moisture analysis.  This file is
self-documented, refer to it for details.

OPTRAN

The NESDIS forward radiance model called OPTRAN is incorporated into
the current release of LAPS.  Details of OPTRAN are available from:

Tom Kleespies
NOAA/NESDIS
tkleespies@nesdis.noaa.gov

Also OPTRAN can be used by any U.S. Government or U.S. Military
entity without problem.  ALL other users need to contact NESDIS (Tom
Kleespies) and receive authorization to use this software.  Generally a
simple acknowledgement to give full credit to the program author is all
that is required.  FSL assumes no obligation or responsibility in
integrating this software as part of LAPS.  To disable the use of
OPTRAN in LAPS, simply assign the GOES option in the moisture_switch.nl
namelist file to zero.

The version of OPTRAN in LAPS is configured to work with GOES 8 and 10
sounder or imager at this time.  Note also that GOES imager channel 3
(water vapor) is currently not working for both satellites. 
Furthermore sounder radiances for GOES 10 are deemed about 98%
reliable, they are 100% reliable for GOES 8.  NaN values have been
observed being generated from the GOES 10 sounder coefficients that
currently accompany this software.  At this time there are only basic
provisions to handle the NaN state conditions.  They have not been
observed to crash the moisture analysis and seem to be handled
gracefully to date.  Any observation otherwise needs to be communicated
to:

Dan Birkenheuer
NOAA/FSL
Daniel.L.Birkenheuer

To model the atmosphere with OPTRAN, an atmosphere is formulated that
extends to 0.1 hPa.  This is a composite of the normal LAPS analyzed
vertical domain (nominally extending to 100 hPa), spliced together with
a climatological atmosphere of 20 levels that extends to 0.1 hPa.  The
joining of the two vertical coordinate systems is computed
automatically and is continuous.  This will automatically take place
even if the nominal LAPS levels are extended beyond 100 hPa.  In this
upper region, temperature, and mixing ratio are functions of latitude
and Julian day.  Ozone is based on the U.S.  Standard Atmosphere.

CLOUD DATA

Added a switch for enabling cloud data to be used in saturating the air
in cloudy areas.  This is included as the last item in the
moisture_switch.nl file that is maintained under the static area.  To
enable cloud data for saturating the air this is (1) to disable the
feature, set the character to (0).

You might wonder why we need such a switch.  During October (96) we
experienced problems with the cloud analysis.  This was inadvertently
causing problems in the moisture analysis through the cloud saturation
adjustment.  The incorrect moisture was in turn causing the models to
blow up.  Hence we added this switch so that we could easily reactivate
the feature once the cloud analysis was repaired without having to
worry about recompiling any code.

RAOB DATA

The capability to ingest RAOB data into the moisture module has been
available since 1996.

There are two important items to know about:

1) The RAOB data are contained in lapsprd/snd/*.snd files.  The
moisture module will automatically use .snd data if present.  If you do
not wish to use sounding data there are 2 ways to exclude these data,
the most obvious is to not provide .snd files.

2) In the event that you wish to exclude the use of sounding data and
want them to be present in the data directory (possibly for some other
application) you can avoid using them in the moisture code by modifying
the file: ./data/static/moisture_switch.nl

The first record of this ASCII file is used for the RAOB data
inclusion.  The file itself is documented internally following the
second record.  If the first record is "1" (nominal case), the use of
sounding data will be on, and .snd files will be processed if present. 
If this character is "0", the moisture code will not process sounding
data.

ADDENDUM:  routine RAOB_STEP.F

It should be noted that some users have had to modify the parameter that
defines dimensions in routine raob_step.f due to the fact that this can
overflow array limits on some machines.  The current parameter snd_tot
is set to 1000.  The primary reason for this is to accommodate satellite
soundings of which there can be many in even a small area.  This
parameter ties in to the dimensions of the weight matrix
(ii,jj,snd_tot).  If a large horizontal domain is defined, and you don't
have a lot of RAOB data and are not using satellite processed soundings,
you may have better success at compiling this routine by reducing the
value of snd_tot to a smaller value.



GVAP

GVAP data are GOES sounder total precipitable water data acquired from
the sounding retrieval process.  These data were added to LAPS under a
grant from NOAA NESDIS.

The analysis for GVAP data is basically as follows.  Following the
varational adjustment for sounder data, (1Dvar), the Q field is
integrated to give total precipitable water (TPW) at each GVAP
location.  These values are differenced against the GVAP data.  The
differences are then analyzed as a 2D field (difference correction
field) by solving Laplace's equation (minimizing the first derivative).

Routine weight_field.f is then called with a radius of influence of
15km.  A weight field is then generated where a weight of 0.5 is
defined to be at a distance of 15km from a GVAP observation.  GVAP data
locations are provided in array MASK.  A weight_field array is
populated with the highest weight value possible at each i,j, location
determined by the proximity of that location to a GVAP observation
position.

The analysis concludes by applying the difference correction field to
the Q field at all levels, (effectively scaling it up or down) and the
magnitude of this adjustment is controlled by the weight field.  Note
that it is felt that it is appropriate to scale the Q field with a
ratio of TPW since TPW is an absolute measure of moisture as is Q. 
This method assures continuous fields, and limits the corrections to
the radius of influence (15km) deemed appropriate to GVAP measurements. 
At this time the only TPW full column adjustment is made.  At a future
time, it may be worthwhile to design an adjustment based on layer PW
since 3 layers are routinely available from NESDIS.  

------ 2.11 -------------LVD (SATELLITE INGEST) CHANGES------------------------

   There may be some parameters in the satellite code that change when 
   the domain is moved. The latest info documented in the file
   './src/ingest/satellite/lvd/README'. Please contact John Smart 
   (John.R.Smart@noaa.gov) for more details. 

------ 2.12 ----------------OTHER RUNTIME PARAMETERS---------------------------

   It is worthwhile to check the 'nest7grid.parms' and other namelist
   files in 'data/static' to make sure all the runtime parameters are
   correct. Some parameters worth noting are:

<pre>

   nest7grid.parms
   _______________

   c8_project_common - Depends on which "realization" of LAPS you are running.
                       Allowed values are listed within 'nest7grid.parms'.



   cloud.nl
   ________

   l_use_vis -         Boolean set to indicate whether we are confident in the
                       calibration of the visible satellite data and albedo
                       fields for use in the cloud analysis. This is normally 
                       set to .true. at FSL and .false. for WFO and other 
                       ports unless we are confident in the vis data 
                       normalization.
</pre>

------ 2.13 -----Detecting and Reporting Installation Errors-------------------

   To determine how well LAPS was installed, verify that all (31 at last check)
   executables were built OK ('bin' directory) with no errors in the output 
   of 'make'.

   Similarly, check the output of the localization script.
   
   If you have any problems during the configure, install and localization
   process, there are several things to check. For certain platforms, you can 
   compare your build output with ours by clicking on "Results of Latest LAPS 
   Builds" on the LAPS Software page. Also double check that you've followed
   all the installation steps in this section of the README. There is also a 
   FAQ available at http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/birk/LAPS_FACTS.htm 
   Finally, check the release notes at the 
   http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/software/release_notes.html URL.

   If you don't find the answer in these documents, send mail to 
   oplapb@fsl.noaa.gov   Include in your mail:
<pre>
   LAPS version number (hopefully you're using the latest version?)
   The type of system (often, uname -a)
   The system limits (ulimit -a)
   The applicable compiler versions (often a -v or -V option to the compiler)
   The entire output of configure 
   The entire output of make (standard output + error output)
   The entire output of localize_domain.pl (found in $LAPS_DATA_ROOT/log/localize_domain.log)
</pre>

                   ----  2.13.1 Runtime Monitoring ---

   To see how well LAPS is running, check if output files are being placed in 
   the various 'lapsprd' subdirectories. A graphical product monitor that can 
   help with this is available in 'etc/laps_monitor.pl'. This script may need 
   some simple editing to suit your needs (e.g. to specify the 
   $LAPS_DATA_ROOT[s]). The monitor script writes HTML output to 'stdout'. This
   HTML output, if routed to a file or hooked up to a Web server, can be viewed
   with a browser. You can click on 
   http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/monitors/Laps_Monitor.cgi to see an example of the 
   monitor output. Green means optimum product continuity, red means the 
   product is failing to generate, yellow means it is generating OK now but has
   failed in the past.

   Check the log files in the 'log' directory for occurrences of the string
   'error' and 'warning'. The errors are generally more significant. If any
   core dumps occur they can usually be flagged by searching for the 'sh:'
   string in 'sched.log.*'.

   To check what data got into the analyses as well as some QC and error
   (verification) statistics, you can run a series of perl scripts located in
   '$LAPSINSTALLROOT/etc'. This includes 'sfc.pl', 'wind3d.pl', 'temp.pl', 
   'hum3d.pl', and 'cloud.pl'. These scripts operate mainly by distilling other
   log file output. The output from these scripts is also stored in the files
   '$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/log/*.wgi.yydddhhmm'.   

---------- 3.0 ---- DESCRIPTION OF LAPS PROCESSES  ---------------------------

       The following section contains information on which LAPS processes 
   generate which LAPS output products. Static data (like lat and lon  
   grids) are included in section 3.1. These are the processes contained 
   within the LAPS tar file and built with the localization script.

          "Inter data" is an ascii file containing non-gridded data 
   (intermediate data files). Examples of this are surface obs, profiler obs, 
   etc.

          This list contains all outputs generated by LAPS processes.

          The products listed under each process are the outputs produced by 
   that process. Inputs are listed here for some analyses. If the cron
   including 'sched.pl' (see section 2.4) is run according to the flow therein,
   the necessary inputs will be available.

                        and Buoy/ship obs. The format of this file may be 
                        determined from looking at library access routines such
                        as 'read_surface_data', the obs_driver code, or by 
                        looking at sample LSO files in the test data case.

Sample Input/Output: May be available in the test data case.
</pre>

Source directory: $LAPS_SRC_ROOT/src/ingest/sao (contains a README file)

Parameter file (specifies input data paths and formats): 'obs_driver.nl'

The LSO file is fairly self explanatory. The easiest way to see what
goes where is to look at the routine 'read_surface_data' in the file 
'src/lib/read_surface_obs.f', and the corresponding format statements in the 
file 'src/include/lso_formats.inc'. 

The routines are pretty well commented, and should be enough to tell you what 
you need to know if you want to make a decoder that outputs an LSO-type 
formatted file directly. This direct route would allow you to bypass the
step of producing "raw" NetCDF surface observation data. 

Here are a few recommended settings for the observation type
variables (reportType and autoStationType) 
if you are constructing your own LSO file:

<pre>
raw data    reportType    autoStationType
________    __________    _______________
 metar       METAR         UNK (unless an automated A01 or A02 station)
 synop       SYNOP         UNK (unless an automated A01 or A02 station) 
 buoy        MARTIM        FIX
 ship        MARTIM        MVG
</pre>

The expected accuracies are based on "offical" NWS numbers where possible.  
For LDAD observations, they're just a best guess, since no one really knows 
how good the obs are.  These expected accuracies will be used in the quality 
control routines sometime in the future.  The lat/lons are in decimal degrees.

Gross "climatological" QC error checks are applied to several variables
including temperature, wind, and pressure.

Sample Input/Output: May be available in the test data case.
</pre>

Source directory: 'laps/src/ingest/sfc_qc'

The 'lso_qc' file is fairly self explanatory...the comments in the 
'write_surface_obs' routine detail everything.  The expected accuracies are 
based on "offical" NWS numbers where possible.  For LDAD observations, they're
just a best guess, since no one really knows how good the obs are.  These 
expected accuracies will be used in the quality control routines sometime in 
the future.  The lat/lons are in decimal degrees.

This new QC package compares the observations temporally and fills in 
predicted values for an observation when it is only intermittently available.
This helps compensate for temporal changes in data density. A future 
enhancement may be to replicate cloud layer observations for a few hours.
This would be especially helpful when running an hourly LAPS while SYNOP 
stations report clouds only every 3 hours.

------ 3.2.2.3   How to Blacklist stations ---

     (author: Steve Albers/Pete Stamus)
     (description updated: Sept 2003)

As part of the 'obs_driver' code, a Blacklisting function has been added.  This
allows users to tell LAPS to skip stations with known bad variables (one or 
several), or to skip a station completely.  As of this writing, the user will 
have to edit a "Blacklist.dat" file...in the future we hope to include this 
function in the LAPS GUI.

An example file, called "Blacklist.example" has been included in the same 
directory as this README file.  It shows the format that *must* be followed for
the Blacklist to work properly.  An error in the format will either allow the 
bad station(s) through, or crash the program completely.  Let's decode the 
"Blacklist.example" file:

     The first line is the number of obs to blacklist...in this case, 5.
     Each station goes on a new line.  The number of variables to blacklist
     for that station is next, then the codes for the variable(s) follow.  For
     the first station (KFCS), we are blacklisting the 3 pressure variables.
     To blacklist the entire station (KDTW) use 1 for the number of variables,
     and "ALL" as the variable. All the stations from a particular provider can
     be blacklisted by adding 100 to the number of variables (third example). 
     The last two examples show 1 and 2 individual variables, respectively. 


These are the valid codes for variables to blacklist:

<pre>
        "ALL" - Set all variables at this station to bad
        "TMP" - Set temperature bad
        "DEW" - Set dew point temperature bad
        "HUM" - Set relative humidity bad
        "WND" - Set wind bad (this does both speed and direction, and gusts)
        "ALT" - Set altimeter bad
        "STP" - Set station pressure bad
        "MSL" - Set MSL pressure bad
        "VIS" - Set visibility bad
        "CLD" - Set clouds to bad (this does all cloud layers reported)
        "PCP" - Set precipitation amount to bad (all reported, 1-12 hrs)
        "SNW" - Set snow cover to bad
        "SOL" - Set solar to bad (if reported)
        "SWT" - Set soil/water temperature to bad (if reported)
        "SWM" - Set soil moisture to bad (if reported)
</pre>

You might keep in mind that some variables act as a group. For example
both "HUM" and "DEW" variables feed into the LAPS dewpoint analysis so
consideration should be given as to whether to blacklist one or both of
these variables. "ALT", "STP" and "MSL" are a similar group of pressure
variables. An incorrect variable code generates a warning message, and 
the code should hopefully continue without acting on the station in question.

Note that when a station is blacklisted, its name, latitude, longitude, 
elevation, and time, will still be stored in the LSO file.  However, the 
selected variables (up to "ALL" of them) will be set to the 'badflag' value 
and skipped in the analyses.

To actually get this stuff working, edit the file called "Blacklist.dat" in the
'data/static' (or template) directory. The "Blacklist.dat" being used at FSL is
supplied in this directory as a default, and this provides additional examples.
Format the file *exactly* as the 'Blacklist.example' file (using your station 
information, of course).  Save the file, and the next time 'obs_driver' runs, 
it will use the blacklist information.  This will be noted in the 
'obs_driver.log' file.  

------ 3.2.3 --- Polar Radar Data (e.g. WSR 88D Level II, Level III) ---

Process: remap_polar_netcdf.exe 

Author: Steve Albers (Steve.Albers@noaa.gov)

Every volume scan
Initiation: Completion of volume scan

Inputs:
	Wideband Radar Data (reflectivity and velocity in polar coordinates,
        in NetCDF format) These have one tilt per file and at least 4 tilts
        per volume scan (all with the same volume timestamp in the filenames).
        This data can be obtained from a WSR 88-D Level-II data feed or the
        equivalent. A description of how we obtain these Polar NetCDF files 
        for Level-II is at 'http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/albers/remapper_raw.html'.

        The polar NetCDF files are named according to 'yydddhhmm_elevxx' where 
        'xx' is the tilt number.

        Note that narrowband data (e.g. WSR 88D Level-III RPG)
        can also be used as long as it is converted to the required polar 
        coordinate, NetCDF format. This is in fact being done for the AWIPS 
        implementation of LAPS for a low-level tilt from a single radar, via 
        the 'etc/LapsRadar.pl' script running in the AWIPS environment. The 
        comment section at the top of this script explains how this 4 bit
        processing of reflectivity data works. 'etc/LapsRadar.pl' runs two 
        executables. The first executable 'tfrNarrowband2netCDF' from AWIPS, 
        writes out the polar NetCDF files in the directory 
        '$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/lapsprd/rdr/???/raw' where ??? is the radar number.
        The second executable 'remap_polar_netcdf.exe' is run as part of LAPS.

Outputs (LAPS intermediate files - depending on input parameters):
<pre>
     v01         grids       3-D Radar reflectivity, velocity, and Nyquist vel
     v02           "                  "
     rdr/???/vrc   "         2-D Radar reflectivity  (??? = radar number)
     vrc           "                  "
     etc. (for each radar)
</pre>

The outputs from this process, on the Cartesian LAPS grid, are used by the 
LAPS wind analysis, and also potentially by cloud and precip accumulation 
analyses. One output file is written per volume scan.

When running the remapper, files such as v01, v02, vrc, etc. are produced 
depending on which radar is being used and on the input parameters. 
A further description of how the remapper software functions may be found on 
the World Wide Web at 'http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/albers/remapper_laps.html'.
Also recall the flow chart showing the inputs and outputs for 
'remap_polar_netcdf.exe' at 
'http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/albers/laps/radar/laps_radar_ingest.html'.

Source directory: The source code for this is in 'src/ingest/radar/remap'.

Sample Input/Output: May be available in the test data case.

------ 3.2.4 -------- WSI / NOWRAD RADAR PREPROCESSING (VRC) ------------------

Process: VRC (vrc_driver.x) 

Author John Smart (John.R.Smart@noaa.gov)

<pre>
Inputs:
        Raw WSI NOWRAD radar reflectivity data
        v01, v02, etc.                        3-D reflectivity  (proposed)

Outputs (Intermediate data file):
        vrc     grid                          2-D reflectivity
        vrz     grid                          3-D reflectivity  (proposed)
</pre>

The WSI data are decoded externally to LAPS and written as
netCDF files in NIMBUS format. The vrc_driver.x process reads these netCDF 
files. WSI sends out many types of radar data. We use the files
that are labeled "_hd" (15 min freq). They also send out an "_hf"
(5 min freq) file.  We use hd because WSI hand edits these for
ground clutter. The hf files are not edited. The hd and hf files
are composites of "low-level" elevation scans from the 88D's around
the country.  The vrc_driver.x also maps from conus to laps domain
for the wfo data set.  The map transformation software is found in
lib/gridconv, lib/nav, and lib/radar/wsi_ingest. The switch to use
wsi versus wfo in variable c_raddat_type in nest7grid.parms. Pathway
to data is variable path_to_wsi_2d_radar_cmn in nest7grid.parms.

The output reflectivity is used by the cloud and precip accumulation analyses.
                                        
------ 3.2.5 --------------- Radar Mosaic ------------------------------------

Process: (mosaic_radar.exe) 

Author Steve Albers (Steve.Albers@noaa.gov) / John Smart (John.R.Smart@noaa.gov)

<pre>
Inputs:
        v01, v02, etc.                        3-D reflectivity  
        rdr/001/vrc, rdr/002/vrc, etc.        2-D reflectivity

Outputs (Radar Mosaic - intermediate data file):
        vrz     grid                          3-D reflectivity  
        vrc     grid                          2-D reflectivity
</pre>

This program runs once per LAPS cycle in the 'sched.pl'. The default is to 
write just one mosaic file for the cycle valid at 'systime'. A namelist option
allows this program to produce multiple mosaic outputs within a given LAPS
cycle. The multiple mosaics are all run at the same wall clock time, while the
valid mosaic times are spaced throughout the previous LAPS cycle.

The nearest radar with valid data is the one chosen to contribute at each
grid-point.

The output reflectivity mosaic is used by the cloud and precip accumulation 
analyses. Further QC is done within these analyses.

Process: wind.exe - WIND analysis and related fields

Author: Steve Albers (Steve.Albers@noaa.gov)

	Generate a wind analysis using surface observations, profiler, cloud
        drift wind, and aircraft reports. VAD and SODAR can also be read in.
        Background model grids are used as a first guess and to do quality 
        control on new observations. Time tendencies from the background model
        are applied to the aircraft/cloud-drift wind reports when they are 
        taken before or after the nominal analysis time. The quality control 
        rejects any observations deviating from the background by more than a 
        threshold depending on observation type as in the following table. 

<pre>
        ACARS               10 m/s
        Cloud-Drift winds   10 m/s
        Profiler            22 m/s
        Doppler Radar       12 m/s
        Other               30 m/s
</pre>

        The wind analysis is done in three steps. The first step analyzes the 
        non-radar data with the background wind field using a multiple 
        iteration successive correction technique.

        For the second step, the first step results are used as the background.
        The data used includes non-radar data; any grid-points with multiple-
        Doppler radial velocities are also mixed in. Radial velocities are 
        taken from the Doppler radars after dealiasing and other quality 
        control steps are done. If two or more radars illuminate a given 
        grid-point, a full wind-vector is constructed from a combination of 
        the radial velocities and the preliminary non-radar analysis. This is 
        done via a "successive insertion" process, beginning with the 
        background (non-radar analysis), then followed with the radial velocity
        from each radar in sequence.

        For the final step the background field comes from the result of
        the second step. All point data is now used, including grid-points 
        illuminated by only a single radar. The tangential component for each
        radar observation is estimated by using the background from the 
        previous step (i.e. non-radar data and/or multi-radar data).

        The omega field is calculated by kinematically integrating the 
        horizontal wind divergence. The lower boundary condition is specified
        by the surface wind and terrain gradient.

------ 3.3.2 ----------------- SFC (LSX) -------------------------------------

Surface processing - laps_sfc.x (LSX) 
     (authors: John McGinley / Pete Stamus / Steve Albers)

The surface package collects surface data from the LSO intermediate data file  
(METARs, local mesonets via LDAD, buoy/ship obs), IR brightness temperatures,
and fields from selected background models.  Places surface data on LAPS grid
and performs a simple quality control of the obs (climo + standard deviation
checks). The quality control is described in the section below at (3.3.2.2).  
A flow chart can be seen at this URL:
http://laps.fsl.noaa.gov/albers/laps/talks/sfc/Sfc_anal.gif

The background fields come from the locally-run LAPS model (FSF file), other
large-scale models (RUC, ETA, AVN - via the LGB file), or a previous analysis 
(if all else fails). If the background model terrain is on a coarser grid than
LAPS, this is accounted for so that the LGB fields have the fine-scale terrain
related structure. For wind fields, the background comes from the 3-D wind 
interpolated to the surface or LWM file. Data, both inside and outside the LAPS
grid is used via an initial Barnes analysis of the observations to set the 
boundary conditions.  

Prior to analysis of each field, another quality control step is done that 
rejects observations that deviate from the background by more than a threshold.
This threshold is proportional to the standard deviation of the observation
increments.

The next step in the analyses is done with a successive correction technique 
similar to the 3-D wind and temperature analyses (see those sections and their
web references). Observation increments are used for T, Td, U, V, MSL, P
and straight observations are used for visibility. The temperature and dewpoint
observations are also corrected for deviations of the station elevation from
the LAPS terrain. Standard lapse rates are applied to this elevation difference.

A land fraction term is factored into the weighting whenever the observation
and grid point are on either sides of a 0.01 land fraction threshold. This
helps prevent situations such as heating over the land having undue effects
over the water areas. This weight is applied mainly
to the T, Td, U, and V fields.

For pressure analysis, three fields are computed including reduced pressure (P)
at reference height 'redp_lvl', surface pressure (PS), and mean sea level 
pressure (MSL). Background pressure fields come from the LGB or FSF files. 
The MSL background is used as read in upon input. The (PS) background is 
converted from the background model terrain to the LAPS terrain within the 
LGB/FSF file. The (P) background is generated by reducing the (PS) background
to the reference analysis height 'redp_lvl' using Poisson's equation. 

Continuing the pressure analysis the altimeter setting observations are 
converted to station pressures using the standard atmosphere. Station 
pressure observations are in turn converted to reduced pressure using 
Poisson's equation. The (P) analysis uses the (P) background plus the 
reduced pressure observation increments. The (P) analysis then 
uses variational techniques to constrain the surface winds and reduced 
pressures (P) to the full equations on motion. In contrast, mean sea level 
pressure (MSL) is a direct analysis of the MSLP observation increments 
together with the model background 'MSL' field. The station pressure analysis
(PS) is calculated using the model background gridded 'PS' field, together 
with the deviations of the MSLP analysis from the MSLP background. 

Visibility is arrived at by first analyzing the surface visibility 
observations. A second step is applied to decrease the visibility in areas
that have high RH and are near the cloud base that is given by the cloud
analysis (in the previous time cycle).

Several derived variables are calculated before the LSX file is written.  Also,
a dependent data validation is done by interpolating several variables back to
the observation locations and comparing the analysis to the obs.  Output from 
this check is written to files located in 
'$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/log/qc/laps_sfc.ver.hhmm', where 'hhmm' is the analysis 
'systime'.

         T, Td, Wind, MSLP, Reduced P (reference height sfc), Surface P

         Fire Danger: 
             LAPS fire weather index is driven mainly by the surface fields
             of current humidity, wind, and temperature. RH and wind have
             the most weight with temperature having a lesser weight for
             this index that ranges from 0 to 20. Snow cover, elevation, and 
             land fraction are given secondary consideration. High
             elevations, assumed to be above the treeline, are given a lower
             maximum value of 10. This index was developed primarily by 
             Matt Kelsch of FSL.

         Colorado Severe Storms Index: 
             Severe storm potential mostly geared to the Colorado area. This
             uses a decision tree and various empirical functions. For more
             info please check the documentation in subroutine 'make_cssi'.

         Heat Index:
             A function of temperature and humidity for discomfort due to heat.

             This is based on a formula from Lans Rothfusz, NOAA/NWS. It is
             calculated only when the surface air temperature exceeds 75 deg F.

             The idea is to give a "feels like" temperature.  For example, if 
             the temperature is 85 F but the heat index is 100 F, most people 
             would respond physically like it was 100 F actual temperature.  
             It's generally used to warn people that the temperature and 
             humidity will combine to make it seem hotter than it actually is, 
             and that they should take precautions like drinking more water, 
             stay out of the direct sun, take frequent breaks if working 
             outside, etc.

--------- 3.3.2.1 ------SURFACE ANALYSIS RUNTIME PARAMETERS -------------------

   PRESSURE REDUCTION

        You will need to select an elevation for the reduced pressure analysis.
	The reduced pressure is the only one really used in the variational
	portion of LAPS, and the idea is to select an elevation that is 
	representative of the domain (or portion of the domain) you are
	interested in.  For example, the Colorado LAPS domain includes 4000m
	high mountains over the western 1/3, and plains that slope below 
	1000m at the eastern boundary.  We use 1500m as the Colorado LAPS
	reduced pressure.  This is close to the elevations over the eastern
	2/3's of the domain, and requires a smaller reduction over the 
        mountains compared to MSL, for example.  Change the namelist variable 
        in '/data/static/surface_analysis.nl' when you localize LAPS.

   SURFACE THETA CHECK	

        In the 'surface_analysis.nl' file, set the 'itheta' flag for the 
        surface theta check.  This check adjusts the surface potential 
        temperatures so they are not greater than the potential temperature at
        an upper level.  Set this variable equal to the desired upper level 
        (or if you don't want to do this check):

	                0 = No sfc theta check done
	                7 = Use 700 mb level
	                5 = Use 500 mb level
                       -1 = Automatically choose 5 or 7 based on terrain info
                            7 is used if center grid point is below 1000m
                            5 is used if center grid point is above 1000m

	Recommended:  Use 700 mb most places, 500 mb over higher terrain 
	areas (like Colorado).

--------- 3.3.2.2 ------SURFACE ANALYSIS QUALITY CONTROL -------------------

        LAPS has a layered QC approach that gives us several opportunities
        to flag erroneous observations. To start with, a variety of gross
        "climo" checks are applied to the observations in the 'obs_driver.x' 
        ingest program.

        The next steps in quality control are encountered in 'laps_sfc.x'.
	This first checks the observations against climatologically
        reasonable ranges. Next, the observations (most fields except wind)
        are checked to see which ones are outliers (at 5 sigma) relative to 
        the average observation value in the domain. As a further check, the 
        Temperatures, Dewpoints and MSL pressures are checked to see if they 
        deviate from the background field by more than a threshold absolute
        amount. The output from these checks is in both 'laps_sfc.log' and 
        'sfcqc.log'. The 'sfcqc.log' file contains the 'rely' (positive=retain,
        negative=reject) values designated as follows:
<pre>
               |  STANDARD DEVIATION CHECK (against other obs)
               |
         CLIMO |  PASS   N/A    FAIL 
               |____________________________
               |
          PASS |   +35    10    -15
               |
          FAIL |   -99   -99    -99
          
           -25        failed model background comparison
           -99        observation was missing
</pre>

        If you wish to skip over these steps, you can change the 
        'surface_analysis.nl' namelist file. This is recommended when using 
        the separate flag to use the experimental Kalman quality control 
        observation file (lso_qc), generated by 'sfc_qc.exe'. 

        There is an additional check for all analyzed fields (except visibility) 
        within the 'spline' routine that rejects stations deviating from the 
        background by more than a threshold number of standard deviations of 
        the observation increments. This threshold can be independently 
        adjusted (i.e. tightened or loosened) for each field via the 
        'surface_analysis.nl' namelist. If you see any bulls-eyes in the 
        surface analysis that you don't believe, try contacting Steve Albers 
        at FSL for more information on making these quality control namelist
        adjustments.

        The experimental Kalman QC package 'sfc_qc.exe' (outlined in 3.2.2.2) 
        compares the observations temporally and fills in predicted values for 
        an observation when it is only intermittently available. This helps 
        compensate for temporal changes in data density. The log file for this
        new program is in 'sfc_qc.log'. 

--------- 3.3.2.3 ------SURFACE ANALYSIS VERIFICATION -------------------

        Verification statistics for the surface analyses are written to the
        'log/qc/laps_sfc.ver.hhmm' files. These contain information of
        obs differences relative to the background and the analysis. The
        obs listed have had most of the QC checks already applied, though
        an ob may have been rejected in the analysis by the final "spline 
        standard deviation" check yet still have a non-missing value listed
        in the QC files. 

------ 3.3.3 ---------------------TEMP----------------------------------------

Process: temp.exe - Temperature-Height analysis

	Generate a temperature analysis using model background, sfc temp
        analysis, and RASS data.

        Quality control is applied to the temperature soundings. If any
        level in a sounding differs from the model background by more than
        a threshold (~10 deg), the entire sounding is rejected.

------ 3.3.4 ---------------------CLOUD---------------------------------------

Process: cloud.exe - Cloud analysis package

Author: Steve Albers (Steve.Albers@noaa.gov)

	Several input analyses are combined with METARs of cloud layers. These 
        input analyses are the 3D temperature analysis,  a three-dimensional 
        LAPS radar reflectivity analysis derived from full volumetric radar 
        data, and a cloud top analysis derived from GOES IR band eight data.

	Vertical cloud soundings from METARs and pilot reports are analyzed 
        horizontally to generate a preliminary three-dimensional analysis.  
        This step provides information on the vertical location and 
        approximate horizontal distribution of cloud layers.

	The satellite cloud-top temperature field is converted to a cloud-top 
        height field using the three-dimensional temperature analysis.  The 
        cloud-top height field is then inserted into the preliminary cloud 
        analysis to better define the cloud-top	heights as well as to increase
        the horizontal spatial information content of the cloud analysis.  
        A set of rules is employed to resolve conflicts between METAR and
	satellite data.  Finally, the three-dimensional radar reflectivity 
        field is inserted to provide additional detail in the analysis.

 ------ 3.3.5 -----------WATER VAPOR (HUMIDITY PROCESSING)----------------

Last updated: 5/27/99 by Daniel Birkenheuer

Code organization:

   The moisture code is coordinated by the LQ3 modules all of which (with
   the exception of libraries) exist under ./src/humid/.  The
   main driver, lq3driver.x contains only one subroutine call at this time.

   ./src/humid/lq3_driver1a.f (Module) <active>

   is the primary moisture processing module that sequences the various
   subroutines.

   There is a second routine that formerly was used for HSM satellite
   processing; it is currently deactivated:

   ./src/humid/lq3_driver1b.f (Module) <deactivated>.

   Now, using the GOES forward radiance model and more advanced techniques,
   the satellite inclusion takes place in the above "1a" module. Treat the
   "1b" module as orphan code.


Control file:

   ./data/static/moisture_switch.nl

   Is an ASCII file intended for easy editing and control of the moisture
   modules activities.  The first record controls usage of RAOB data
   (0=off, 1=on).  The second record controls usage of satellite data (LVD
   files) and again (0=off; 8=on, use GOES-8, 9=on, use GOES-9).  This
   module is exported with the RAOB feature OFF and the satellite feature
   ON and SET FOR GOES-8.  The third switch enables (1) or disables (0)
   saturating air in cloudy areas. The fourth now enables using sounder 
   data in lieu of imager data (GOES only).  This should be set to (0) for
   the current time.

Input files:

   Inputs (status as of August 1996) ("grid" designates LAPS netCDF grid
   file unless otherwise stated):

                        PRIMARY ALGORITHM SUMMARIES

RAOB ENHANCEMENT:

     The RAOB data are added to the analysis via a second pass Barnes
     analysis.  Normally, a Barnes analysis consists of two parts.
     The first fills the entire domain with values weighted by the
     distance to the neighboring points.  In the second pass, a
     difference field (derived from the difference of the first pass
     and the observations) is added to the result from the first pass
     with adjusted weights to better tune to the scale of interest.

     In this application we skip the first pass using instead the
     "background" analysis in place of the result of the first pass
     Barnes' result.  The difference field is then generated and
     applied using a set of weights appropriate for the LAPS domain
     resolution and density of observations.

SATELLITE ALGORITHM:
     An essential ingredient of the variational method is a satellite
     forward radiance model.  The forward model produces a simulated
     radiance based on temperature, moisture, and ozone profiles along
     with the temperature of the surface or cloud top, and the
     pressure of that radiating surface (i.e., surface pressure or
     cloud top pressure whichever applies).   Also needed are the
     zenith angle, used to determine the air mass path and optical
     depth between the radiator and the satellite.  The forward model
     used for this work was obtained from NESDIS.  The forward model
     coefficients used for this study were vintage late 1995.

     In order to apply the forward model appropriately, a
     determination of clear and cloudy fields-of-view (FOV) need to be
     determined.  The LAPS cloud analysis is used to identify clear
     and cloudy LAPS grid points.  The analysis as presented here is
     only working from FOVs classified as clear.  Cloudy FOVs probably
     can be used, but this is an early attempt at this technique, so a
     conservative approach was chosen.  Later research may focus on
     using a combination of both clear and cloudy FOVs in the
     algorithm.

     The first step in the algorithm is to assure all the data needed
     for proper execution are present.  These include channel
     radiances derived from AWIPS imagery, the LAPS cloud analysis
     output, the LAPS surface temperature output, and LAPS 3-D
     temperatures.  The forward model also requires an ozone profile
     along with moisture and temperature profiles above 100 hPa.
     These are gotten from climatology since LAPS extends only to 100
     hPa.  The entire ozone profile is provided by the forward model
     since LAPS does not analyze this parameter.

     Next, the forward model is run to verify "clear" LAPS gridpoints,
     where clear is defined as those points in which both the modeled
     and measured GOES image radiances in channel 4 (11 micron) agree
     to with 2K.  This step uses the LAPS thermal and as yet
     unmodified moisture profiles.  Disparity in the channel 4
     brightness temperature comparison indicates that the LAPS thermal
     profile is too far off or perhaps it is really cloudy where the
     LAPS cloud analysis is indicating it is clear.  (It doesn't have
     to be totally cloudy for a disparity to exist, it can be
     partially cloudy and this will still be detectable in this
     difference test.)   This is a conservative test; it really goes
     beyond simple cloud detection though that is a likely cause of
     differences, the forward model check is very sensitive and in
     many ways eliminates any thermal profiles that subsequent
     variational technique will find difficult to deal with.  We are
     basically saying that we will not worry about moisture adjustment
     unless the thermal profiles are reasonable.

     At this point, all gridpoints offering promise of moisture
     adjustment have been identified.  If the domain is totally
     cloudy, the GOES adjustment is discontinued and returns
     unmodified moisture values which are passed to the final QC step.
     Assuming some gridpoints have been classified as clear, the next
     step is a variational adjustment at those locations.  The
     functional evaluated at each gridpoint has the form (using TEX-
     type ASCII, ^=superscript and _=subscript),
<pre>
           5                             3
     J = sum [R^o_i -R(t,o,cw)_i]^2  + sum  (1-c_k)^2        (1)
         i=3                           k=1
</pre>
     where the goal is to determine the optimum set of three
     coefficients.  Each coefficient, c_k is a scaling factor for the
     moisture corresponding to three atmospheric layers (k).   The
     layers range from surface to 700 hPa (k=1), 700 - 500 hPa (k=2),
     and above 500 hPa (k=3).  The forward model radiance (R) is a
     function of LAPS temperature (t), ozone climatology profile (o),
     and LAPS mixing ratio (w).  The moisture profile is scaled with
     the appropriate coefficient (c).  The observed radiance derived
     from AWIPS image data is designated as R^o_i  where subscript i
     indicates the imager channel number.

     The first term in the functional maximizes agreement between the
     forward model and observed radiance at the expense of only
     modifying the water vapor profile.  The second term adds
     stability and gives more weight to solutions in which the
     coefficients departure from unity (no change to the initial
     profile) is minimized.  The stability term was discovered to be
     necessary since without it some very good radiance matches were
     solved but with unreasonable coefficients.

     Note that differences in all three channels are minimized in this
     technique, not only the moisture channel.  Thus, any improvement
     in the "dirty window," channel 5, will also contribute to the
     solution.  A variational technique is used to minimize this
     function and typically requires three to 10 iterations to
     converge. A limit of 50 iterations was set as the maximum number
     to attempt.  If limit was reached, that particular gridpoint was
     excluded and treated as cloudy.

     Once the coefficients are determined, Laplaces equation is solved
     for interior points for which coefficients have not been
     determined.  Then the entire domain is averaged using a spatial
     invariant filter; simply averaging the values in a 3x3 gridpoint
     window, assigning that average to the window's central grid
     location.

     When the coefficients have been determined, they are applied to
     the specific humidity  field at each pressure level for which
     they are designated.  The modified specific humidity field is
     then advanced to the final analysis step.  In this August 1996
     release, the coefficient adjustment is limited to above 500 hPa
     only.

                                       7 - Freezing Drizzle "F"
                                    SPT uses simple 0 dbz reflectivity 
                                    threshold to define areas of precip.
                                    PTT uses a 13 dbz threshold for non-snow
                                    precip (~.01"/hr), 0 dbz is still used
                                    for snow though a surface dewpoint
                                    depression threshold is used to filter out
                                    areas of snow virga not reaching the ground.
                                    The latter may be more useful for display
                                    purposes by end users. PTT also utilizes
                                    METAR data to delineate areas of drizzle,
                                    freezing drizzle, rain, freezing rain, 
                                    and snow - in areas that radar does not

                                SFC cloud type (SCT)
                                    This is the type of the lowest cloud layer
                                    in the LTY (3-D cloud type) file. The 
                                    cover threshold is 0.65. The presence of 
                                    a CB higher up has priority. There are
                                    10 possible cloud types.

This program is in the early stages of development and provides a three
layer analysis of soil conditions. A snow cover analysis is included.
The fractional snow cover is a composite over time of information from the 
cloud analysis (visible and IR satellite), and snow accumulation (derived 
mainly from radar). More documentation can be found within the source code.

The balance package starts by inputting the results from a simple, offline 
cloud model which retrieves liquid and ice partitioning and an estimate of 
vertical motion from the observed clouds (lwc/lco). The variational scheme 
is designed to accept cloud vertical motion estimates and ice and water 
content as observations. The cloud observations are fully coupled to the 
three dimensional mass and momentum field using dynamical constraints 
which minimize the local tendency in the velocities and ensure continuity 
is satisfied everywhere. 

The scheme performs the analysis on the difference from an input model 
background with the benefit that existing background model balances need not 
be recreated each model cycle and that background model error daily compiled 
is input explicitly on a gridpoint by gridpoint basis.

------- 3.4  ----  Model Initialization & Postprocessing ---------------------

   The main FSL contacts for information on how we use the analyses to 
   initialize the forecasts are as follows: Brent Shaw for MM5/WRF, 
   Paul Schultz for RAMS/SFM, and Adrian Marroquin for ETA. The models 
   themselves are not included in this tar file.

------ 3.4.1 --------------LAPSPREP------------------------------------------

Process: lapsprep.exe - Post-processes LAPS analysis files into formats
                        that can be used to initialize a local forecast
                        model (e.g., MM5, RAMS, WRF)
   
     (author: Brent Shaw)

   This process reformats LAPS data into files suitable for initializing
   a mesoscale forecast model.  The output format is controlled by the
   "output_format" entry in lapsprep.nl and can be set to one of the  
   following:

      output_format = 'mm5'
        This causes the program to output a file in the MM5v3 
        pregrid (v4) format that can be read in by MM5 the "regridder"
        pre-processor.  See the NCAR MM5 REGRID documentation for
        the format specification of this output file.  

      output_format = 'rams'
        This causes the program to output a file in the RAMS 4.x
        "RALPH2" format.  These files can be read in by the 
        RAMS ISAN pressure stage process.  Note that RALPH2 files
        are in ASCII, so these files are actually human-readable.  
        See the RAMS RALPH2 format specification for 
        documentation.

      output_format = 'wrf'
        This causes the program to output a file in the WRF 
        Standard Initialization "grib_prep" format.  These 
        files can be read by the WRF SI "hinterp" process.

   There are three other namelist entries in the lapsprep.nl
   file:
  
      hotstart:  Set to '.true.' if you wish to include the
                 cloud species from the cloud analysis in the
                 output files.  This currently only applies
                 when output_format is equal to 'mm5' or 
                 'wrf'. 
 
      balance:   Set to '.true.' if you wish to use the 
                 wind and temperature analysis files from the
                 balance package.  This will only work if
                 LAPS is running the balance package.

      adjust_rh: Set to '.true.' if you wish to use the 
                 adjusted RH analysis from the balance
                 directory. 

   This program essentially replaces part of the "dprep.exe"
   functionality, in that it produces initial conditions files
   for your local forecast model.  If running a forecast model    
   in real time, then this program should be executed immediately
   following the LAPS analysis during the hours in which the
   model will be initialized.  It can simply be run as the
   last entry in sched.pl, which means you will always have
   an initial condition file avaialble immediately following 
   your LAPS analysis.  

   To actually initialize a forecast model, you will still need
   to run the appropriate program to build the lateral boundary 
   condition files, as LAPSPREP does not provide this function.

-------- 4.0 --  Porting code mods from LAPS users back to FSL --------------

   We would like to encourage suggestions from LAPS users on how to improve
   LAPS, both scientifically and in the software itself. In general, we should 
   follow a carefully orchestrated procedure to port code improvements back 
   from LAPS users to FSL that may be called "virtual RCS". This is essential 
   to insure compatability as well as to preserve ongoing code developments 
   by FSL and various LAPS users. Prior to making the mods, a LAPS user 
   should "check out" a well defined set of modules from the latest LAPS 
   release (or developmental code from the FSL in-house "parallel" side). 
   This is done in close coordination with the FSL code author(s), listed in
   Section 3. The user can then modify that portion of the code while we 
   temporarily suspend FSL development on that set of modules. The modified 
   code can then be ported back to FSL (along with a log of the code mods 
   suitable for entry into the Revisions logs) for testing and integration 
   into the next LAPS release. 

   In some cases, a less formal process may be easier to go by. Here, the
   user can provide documentation of suggested mods either in descriptive form,
   or in terms of before and after code. The code author can then implement
   the changes in the FSL version. This can be useful in the event the mods are
   simple, or if the user has been working with a relatively old version of
   the software and/or there have been significant recent FSL mods to the
   software. This can also be useful if the user has an idea of a desired
   functionality within LAPS, but has not actually looked at the software
   details associated with implementing the functionality.

   It should be noted that it can be problematic for us to accept software 
   modified by users if the mods were not made on the latest developmental
   FSL version of the particular files. This is because it can be tricky to 
   reconcile two sets of software that have been allowed to diverge and evolve 
   independently. The changes that have occurred in both would have to be
   reconstructed in detail. It is recommended instead that one of the 
   procedures in the first two paragraphs of this section be followed.
