LAPS GUI

1.0 INTRO
---------

The WRF standard initialization graphical user interface (GUI) 
package automates domain localization.


2.0 INSTALLING the LAPS GUI:
---------------------

2.1 Installation Requirements
-----------------------------

The following packages are required:

      ---   2.1.1  Perl           ---

The perl package is also required for LAPS; it is available
via internet at any gnu site such as 'ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu'.
Perl 5.003 or higher is required. Check that 'perl' is in your path.

      ---   2.1.2  Perl/Tk        ---

The Tk extension does not come with the standard Perl distribution. If it is not
on your system it is easy to install by visiting the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network) at www.cpan.org/authors/id/NI-S, looking for the most recent
version in the form of Tk800.023.tar.gz. Once you get the tar file, unzip,
untar and install it.

The WRF GUI is located with the WRF source code in a directory called laps/gui.

      ---   2.1.3  C             ---

There are a few C routines in the library.  gcc is the recommended
compiler.

      ---   2.1.4   make          ---

The Makefiles (top level, src/lib and src/grid) work with either
Unix or GNU make utilities (version 3.75 or higher).  GNU make
is available at any gnu site such as 'ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu'.
You can check the version of gnu make by typing 'make -v'. 


2.2  LAPS Directory Overview
-----------------------------
Before building and running the LAPS system, it is useful to understand
the directory structure we use and the rationale.  There are four distinct
"top-level" directories refer to the LAPS README.


2.3 Building LAPS GUI
----------------------
 
perl install_gui.pl --source_root=$SOURCE_ROOT --installroot=$INSTALLROOT 

   --source_root=/your/source/root
     Set if you want to use a different set of source code than
             the one contained in the directory with the install script
   --installroot=/your/installroot/
     Set this to install in a directory other than SOURCE_ROOT

By installing, you get:

$INSTALLROOT/gui/data
     "          /data
     "          /data/maps
     "          /doc
     "          /guiTk
     "          /guiTk/icons
     "          /perlTk
     "          /src

bin:        contains the two required binary executables;
gui/guiTk:  contains the perl/Tk scripts and modules to run GUI;
